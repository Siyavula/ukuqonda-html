    <p class="Body-opener-no-indent" lang="en-US">
    In this chapter you will work with numbers smaller than 0.
    These numbers are called negative numbers. Mathematicians have agreed that negative numbers should have certain properties that will make them useful for various purposes. You will learn about these properties and how they make it possible to do calculations with negative numbers.</p>

    <h2 lang="en-US">8.1	The need for numbers called integers</h2>

    <p class="Body-no-indent" lang="en-US">Numbers are used for many different purposes. We use numbers to say how many objects there are in a collection, for example the number of desks in a classroom. For this purpose we use the
     <b>counting numbers</b> 1,
    2, 3, 4 . . . Numbers are also used to describe size, for example the lengths of objects. For this purpose we need more than the counting numbers, we also need  <b>fractions</b>. Another purpose of numbers is to indicate position, for example the position of the right end of the red line on the pictures below.</p>

    <p class="Body" lang="en-US">Numbers also occur as the solutions to equations, and the natural numbers and fractions do not provide solutions for all equations. For example, there is no natural number or fraction that is the solution to the equation \(10 - x = 20\). The number that provides the solution to this equation must have the property that when you subtract it, it has the same effect as when you add 10!</p>

    <p class="Body" lang="en-US">With a view to have numbers that can serve more purposes than counting and measuring, mathematicians have decided to also think of another kind of numbers which are called  <b>integers</b>. The integers include the natural numbers, but for each natural number, for example 24, there is also another number called the  <b>additive inverse</b>. For example, -24 is the additive inverse of 24. When you add a number to its additive inverse, the answer is 0. For example,
    \(24 + (-24) = 0\).</p>

    <h3 class="Head-investigation--after-b-head-" lang="en-US">saying how cold it is</h3>

    <p class="Body-no-indent" lang="en-US">One of the uses of integers is for the measurement of temperature. If we say that the temperature is 0 when water freezes to become ice, we need numbers smaller than 0 to describe the temperature when it gets even colder than when water freezes. When water starts boiling, its temperature is 100 degrees on the scale called the Celsius scale.</p>

    <p class="Body" lang="en-US">Liquids expand when heated, and shrink when cooled down. So when it is warm,
    the liquid in a thin tube may almost fill the tube:</p>

    <span><img class="medium" src="Maths2_Gr7_TG_rev4-web-resources/image/139036.png" alt="139036.png"/></span>&#160;</p>

    <p class="Body-no-indent" lang="en-US">When it is cold, the column of liquid will be quite short.</p>

    <p class="Body-no-indent" lang="en-US">This property of liquid is used to measure temperature, and an instrument like the above is called a  <b>thermometer</b>.</p>

    <p class="Body-no-indent" lang="en-US">This is what a thermometer will show when it is put in water that is boiling. It shows a temperature of 100 degrees Celsius, which is written as 100 &#176;C.</p>

    You already know that an algebraic expression is a computational procedure. It tells you what calculations you must do with the value of one variable, to produce the value of another variable. In this chapter, we extend the work you have already done to include algebraic expressions with integer constants, including negative numbers.</p>

    <p class="Body-opener-no-indent" lang="en-US">
    Data handling is the part of Mathematics that deals with numbers and facts that we collect about the world around us. Data can be many different things, for example people's opinions on politics or the success rates of treating people with a certain kind of medicine. We use data to help us make decisions and solve problems about the world around us.</p>

    <p class="Body-opener" lang="en-US">In this chapter you will focus on: collecting data using questionnaires; organising data, which includes using stem-and-leaf displays and grouping data into intervals; and then summarising data by determining the mode, median, mean and range of sets of numerical data.</p>


    <h2 lang="en-US">13.1	Collecting data</h2>

    <p class="Body-no-indent" lang="en-US">Think of something that you really want to know about your own community or about children your age in other schools. For example, "How many Grade 7 learners in South Africa have access to a computer?" What would you find interesting to know about?</p>

    <p class="Body" lang="en-US">When you start the cycle of data handling, you start with at least one question. But there can of course be many more questions.</p>

    <p class="Body" lang="en-US">Once you have a research idea in mind, you can start planning how you will collect the data. When you collect data, you need to consider:</p>

    <ul><li class="Body-bullet" lang="en-US">
      <span class="char-style-override-8"></span>what question you are asking</li>

      <li class="Body-bullet" lang="en-US">
      <span class="char-style-override-8"></span>where you will find the data to answer the question (for example from people such as your peers, family or the wider community; or from published sources such as newspapers, books or magazines)</li>

      <li class="Body-bullet" lang="en-US">
      <span class="char-style-override-8"></span>how you will collect the data (for example by using questionnaires or conducting interviews)</li>

      <li class="Body-bullet" lang="en-US">
      <span class="char-style-override-8"></span>who you will collect the data from (the entire population or a sample).</li>
    </ul><h3 class="Head-investigation" lang="en-US">
    populations and samples: from whom to collect data</h3>

    <div class="note"><p class="Body-content-no-indent" lang="en-US">In data handling,  <b>population</b> refers to the whole group you are asking the question about. <b>Sample</b>
            refers to a small number of the group that you think will represent the whole group.</p>
          </div><p class="Body-no-indent" lang="en-US">Here is an example: Thandeka wants to know about the home languages of all Grade 7s across the whole of South Africa. All Grade 7s in all of South Africa would be the population of that data. But it is not possible to reach every single Grade 7 learner in South Africa,
    so Thandeka could choose a sample of Grade 7 learners. For example,
    she could choose to collect data from her own Grade 7 class and from two other Grade 7 classes from two other schools.</p>

    <p class="Body" lang="en-US">But if Thandeka chose her own Grade 7 class and only two other classes from other schools, her sample would not really give information about learners across the whole of South Africa, because the learners in all three of the schools could be from the same language group.</p>

    <p class="Body-no-indent" lang="en-US">So, how can you try to make sure that a sample gives information about the whole population? In other words, how can you make sure that your sample is  <b>representative</b> of the population?</p>

    <p class="Body-investigation-hanging" lang="en-US">1.	<i>Choose a big     enough sample</i>. Generally, the bigger the sample is the more likely it is to represent the characteristics of the population.</p>

    <p class="Body-investigation-hanging" lang="en-US">2.	<i>Ensure that you do not take a sample from only one of the groups within the population.</i> For example, if you want to find out if people like watching soccer, you cannot survey people at a Chiefs versus Pirates match. The majority of these people will almost certainly be there because they love watching soccer!</p>

    <p class="Body-no-indent" lang="en-US">
     <b>Example</b></p>

    <p class="Body-no-indent" lang="en-US">Ganief wishes to find out what the most popular food at the school tuck shop is and surveys 10 learners in Grade 7. There are 2 000 learners at the school.</p>

    <p class="Body" lang="en-US">Give two reasons to explain why the sample chosen is not likely to be representative of the population.</p>

    <p class="Body-no-indent" lang="en-US"><i>
    Answer</i></p>

    <p class="Body-investigation-hanging" lang="en-US">1.	The sample is too small.</p>

    <p class="Body-investigation-hanging" lang="en-US">2.	He is only getting the views of Grade 7s, not of the learners in any of the other grades (who might have very different views).</p>

    <p class="Body-investigation-hanging" lang="en-US">1.	Here are some research questions. Use a  <b>P</b> to show which statement describes the population and an  <b>S</b> to show which statement describes a sample of the population.</p>

      <li class="Body-bullet--indented-" lang="en-US"><span class="char-style-override-8">	</span><i>A sample of schools was selected from       each of these groups.</i></li>

    constructing questionnaires: how to collect data</h3>

    <div class="note"><p class="Body-content-no-indent">A  <b>questionnaire</b> is a sheet with questions used to collect data from people. Each  <b>respondent</b> in the sample completes a questionnaire. The questions on the sheet can be structured differently, for example:</p>

            <p class="Body-content-no-indent"/>
<ul>
  <li>  The questions may require “yes” or “no” answers.</li>
<li>  A selection of answers (multiple-choice answers)

    13.3	Summarising data</h2>

    <p class="Body-no-indent" lang="en-US">When you have collected data, you often need to tell someone what you have found out. People want to know what your conclusions are, without looking at all of the data you have collected.</p>

    <p class="Body" lang="en-US">It is often useful to summarise a set of numerical data by using one value. For example, which value best summarises or describes the following data set?</p>

    <p class="Body-no-indent" lang="en-US">0 1 1 5 8 8 9 9 10 10 10 11 11</p>

    <p class="Body-no-indent para-style-override-8">Statisticians use any of three values that show the most central values in the set, or the value around which the other values tend to cluster. These values are called the <b>measures of central     tendency</b> or <b>summary     statistics</b>.</p>

    <div class="aside">
      <p class="Body-box-no-indent" lang="en-US">

<div class="aside">

            <p class="Body-box-no-indent para-style-override-10" lang="en-US">\(5 + 6 + 3 + 2 + 4 = 20 \\ 20

    When we have collected and organised our data, we often represent it as a graph. This helps us to see the data and patterns in the data more easily. In this chapter, you will revise bar graphs, double bar graphs and pie charts, which you have learnt about in previous grades. You will learn about a new type of graph called a histogram, and how this differs from a bar graph. You will also learn how to draw your own pie charts by estimating fractions of a whole circle.</p>

    By now you should be able to read and interpret data represented in words, bar graphs, double bar graphs, pie charts and histograms. The activities in this chapter will give you more practice in interpreting and analysing such data. At the same time, you will be asked to think critically about the data, especially how the ways in which data is presented can mislead the reader into drawing inaccurate conclusions. You will also practise reporting on data by writing short paragraphs to summarise the data presented to you.</p>

    Probability theory deals with situations that can have many possible outcomes, only one of which actually occurs. For example, when you throw a die, only one face shows - but any of the others could have. Or when you cross a street you usually get to the other side without being struck by a car - but it could have happened.</p>

    <p class="ques-a-" lang="en-US">(a)	Do you expect that the results will in some ways be the same as for the experiment in which you did this in the previous section? Do not talk to your teammates yet. Form your own opinion, and also consider why you think the results will be different or the same.</p>
