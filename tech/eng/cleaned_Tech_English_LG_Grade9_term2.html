    <p class="x--Body-opener">In this chapter, you will revise what
    you know about moving objects with air and water. You will
    learn more about the differences between pneumatic and

    <p class="x--Body-Text">A road roller has a bigger engine than
    a sports car, but moves much slower.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">To make a heavy road roller move, a
    large turning force needs to be applied to the wheels. If the
    output rotational speed of the wheels is much slower than the
    input rotational speed of the engine, then the output
    rotational force will be much bigger than the input rotational
    force. A road roller uses a set of gears that changes the fast
    rotational speed of the engine into a very slow rotational
    speed of the wheels, so that the rotational force at the wheels
    is strong enough to move the heavy road roller.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">With a sports car, a much smaller
    rotational force is needed at the wheels, because the car is
    light. The set of gears used to start moving a sports car also
    changes the fast rotational speed of the engine into a slower
    rotational speed of the wheels, but not as slow as with the
    road roller. So with a sports car, the wheels turn faster but
    with a smaller turning force than the road roller.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-text-1-3">In Chapter 7 you learnt how a
    system of pulleys can give you a mechanical advantage to make
    it easier to hoist up heavy objects. You will now investigate
    how a gear system can do the same, by changing a small turning
    force on the input axle into a big turning force on the output
    axle.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3">Look at Figure 14 below. The

    gear.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">In Figure 26 below, you can see that

    <p class="x--Body-text-1-3 para-style-override-84">The reason

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3 para-style-override-84">As with
    spur gear sets, the slower the output gear turns, the more

    <h2>9.1 Tools at home</h2>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">So far, you have learnt about levers,
    car jacks, pulleys and gears. These tools make life easier for
    us since they give us a <span class=
    "char-style-override-2">mechanical advantage</span>, which in
    turn gives us additional strength, grip and lift.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">It is not only big machines that
    benefit from these advantages. At home, we have many tools that
    also give us a mechanical advantage. You will find them in the
    kitchen, the garden and the garage.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">It is not always obvious that certain
    home tools give us a mechanical advantage. Here are some
    examples to show you how a mechanical advantage can sometimes
    be hidden.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">A bread knife is a <span class=
    "char-style-override-2">lever.</span> It works well to slice
    through bread because it has a long handle.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">A garden spade is also a <span class=
    "char-style-override-2">lever</span> that helps to break the
    surface of the soil. You provide the power (effort) with your
    hands, and your foot is the fulcrum. If you hold the handle
    with one hand and place your other hand on the shaft of the
    spade, your second hand is the fulcrum.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">A spanner is a <span class=
    "char-style-override-2">lever</span> that fits exactly onto a
    nut so that the nut can be tightened or loosened easily.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">An egg beater uses bevel <span class=
    "char-style-override-2">gears</span> to change the direction of
    movement. The whisk spins faster than the handle turns. The
    handle is attached to the driver gear, that has many teeth.
    Imagine that it has 36 teeth. The follower gears have fewer
    teeth than the driver gear. Imagine that they each have 12
    teeth. For every turn of the driver gear, the follower gears
    will turn three times. This gives the mechanical advantage.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Wind pumps or wind turbines spin
    around because the blades are <span class=
    "char-style-override-2">levers</span>. The wind pushes against
    the blade, acting as the force. They also use <span class=
    "char-style-override-2">gears</span> to drive pumps.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">A can opener uses <span class=
    "char-style-override-2">gears</span> and <span class=
    "char-style-override-2">levers</span> to make it easy to cut
    through the lid of a can.</p>

    <h2>9.2 Single vanishing point perspective drawing</h2>

    <p class="x--Body-text-1-3">Think about being in a car or taxi
    driving down a long, straight road. When you look straight
    ahead towards the <span class=

    seem to meet at a point far away, as in this picture.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-Text para-style-override-38">This is called
    the <span class="char-style-override-2">vanishing point.</span>
    Although the road doesn't actually get any narrower, it looks

    vanishes, because of your <span class=
