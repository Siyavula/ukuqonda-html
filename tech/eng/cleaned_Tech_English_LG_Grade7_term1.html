    <p class="x--Body-story">Two girls, Sarah and Tebogo, walk in
    the veld and climb up a small hill. Suddenly, a rock comes
    loose and starts rolling down the hill. It lands on Sarah's
    foot, which gets caught underneath the rock. Tebogo tries to
    lift the rock, but it is too heavy for her. She looks around
    and finds an iron pole. She tries to lift the rock with the
    iron pole and it works! Sarah now manages to pull her foot out
    from underneath the rock.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">Tebogo was not strong enough to lift
    the rock, she used a <span class="Body-bold"><b>tool</b></span>. Tools
    help us to do things that we cannot do with our bodies alone.
    There are other examples of tools, like the ones below.</p>

    <ul>
      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet para-style-override-7">
      Spoons,
      knives and forks are used to eat with.</li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet para-style-override-7">
       We use
      scissors to cut cloth or paper. This works much better than
      tearing cloth or paper with our hands.</li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet para-style-override-7">
       We use
      cellphones to talk to people that are far away from us.
      Cellphones are tools for communication. Two hundred years
      ago, there were no cellphones or landline phones. At that
      time, people could only talk to each other when they were
      close enough to hear each other without using any tools.</li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet">Doctors
      and nurses use a variety of tools to treat people who are
      sick.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="aside">
      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent">Some tools are easy to use,
      like knives, forks and spoons.</p>

      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent">Some tools are a bit more
      difficult to use, like scissors and screwdrivers.</p>

      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent">Some tools are even more
      difficult to use, like a powerdrill. A person who wants to
      use tools like that must be trained.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">About 50 years ago, when your
    grandparents were children, nobody had cellphones. There were
    no television sets in South Africa. Also, most roads in South
    Africa were gravel roads. Tarred roads were only found in and
    around big cities. Most schools didn't have electricity
    either.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent para-style-override-8">Two hundred
    years ago, the world was very different. Electricity had not
    yet been invented. People travelled on foot, on animals or in
    carts and wagons drawn by animals. Ships were powered by people
    who rowed, or by sails which harnessed wind energy.</p>

    <div class="note">
     <p>One thing many people do is develop practical
solutions to problems so that people can have the
things they want and need. To do this, people use
their knowledge and skills. They also use tools and
materials. When developing solutions to problems,
people should try not to damage the environment,
and they should keep the needs and safety of
individuals, families and communities in mind.
All of this together is called Technology.
</p>
    </div>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">All people use tools, man-made
    materials and machines of some kind. Nowadays, people do much
    less with their bare hands and make much less use of natural
    materials than in the past.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">People who are trained to work with
    special tools are called technologists.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Technologists find jobs much more
    easily than people with no training in Technology.</p>

    <div class="Basic-Text-Frame frame-19">
      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent">In a certain small town,
      people get their water from a dam about 3 km away. Then
      something very unfortunate happened. The dam wall broke
      during a flood, and it will take at least two years to build
      a new dam wall. Fortunately, there is an old well near the
      town, with enough water for all the people. But the well is
      very deep and at the moment there is no way to get water to
      the surface. The town is also in a rural area with no
      electricity.</p>

      <p class="x--Body-box">What do you think can be done to get
      the water out of the well? Are you sure your plan will work?
      Can you make a drawing so that other people will understand
      your plan?</p>

    Mr Sethole and he says to you:</p>

    more information so that I can know how to make the
    wheelbarrow. Wheelbarrows are used for different purposes and

 How to say things with
drawings
</h1>
    <p class="x--Body-opener">Sketching and drawing are very
    important skills in Technology. They allow us to share our
    ideas, designs, and technical solutions with other people. In
    this chapter, you will learn what the main purpose of graphics
    are. You will also learn about the different meanings of thick
    and dark lines, thin and feint lines, and dashed lines. And you
    will learn a little bit about scale and how to show sizes on
    drawings. But the most important thing about sketching and
    drawing is that you need to practise. So in this chapter you
    will learn how to do some simple sketches and how to do a flat
    drawing showing sizes.</p>

    like this is called a <span class="Body-bold"><b>working

    shows the real sizes.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3"><span class="Body-bold"><b>Solid

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3">When you want to show something

    hidden objects.</p>

    <div class="aside">
      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent">Just like you use a language
      such as English to communicate with others, sketches and
      drawings are a "language". And just like English, drawings
      have rules to help us understand them better. These rules are
      known as "<span class="char-style-override-2"><b>drawing

    </div>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3">Sizes, which can also be called

    objects.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Short <span class=
    "Body-bold"><b>extension lines</b></span>, which do not touch objects,
    show you what is being measured.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Dimensions are normally given in mm.

 </ol>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">Working drawings are used to design
    things according to exact sizes. Designers communicate the
    exact sizes of each part of an object in working drawings, so
    that each part fits to make the final product work properly.
    For example, a bicycle pump can't have a push rod that won't
    fit inside its outer tube. See Figure 8 below.</p>

    <p class="x--Body--above para-style-override-8">By looking at
    some drawings and practising to sketch, you have learnt to:</p>

    <div class="note">
    
      <ul>
        <li class="x--Body-text-bullet"> Use thin
        feint lines for guidelines, such as the lines for a guide
        box.</li>

        <li class="x--Body-text-bullet"> 
        <span>Use thick lines to show the outside edges of an
        object,</span> <span>such as the edges you can see from the
        front.</span></li>

        <li class="x--Body-text-bullet">  Use a
        solid line to show these edges.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="note">
       <p>You have also learnt that dimensions are shown by
writing the length of an object above a dimension
line.</p><p>
A dimension line has small arrows at each end.
These arrows touch small extension lines that show
where the length starts and where it ends.
Dashed lines show hidden details of drawings.

      <p> Drawings such as Figure 4 (drawing C) are called

In a perspective drawing, the artist tries to show
what she actually sees. You cannot take accurate
measurements from perspective drawings.</p><p>
Drawings such as Figure 5 (drawing D) are called
<b>3D oblique</b> drawings. They look different from
what you actually see when you look at the object.
Measurements can be taken from 3D oblique
drawings.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3 para-style-override-40">To draw a
    box, first draw a rectangle to show the front of the box, as

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3 para-style-override-40">Draw

    Then draw sloping lines as in step 3 to show the edges of the

    <ul>
      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet">  The plates
      on top of a stove are circles. On a drawing like this, they
      will be squashed circles (ellipses).</li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet"> The
      circles for the knobs are real circles. This is because
      everything on the front of the drawing is the same as it is
      in real life.</li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet"> Look at
      how the handle is drawn. It comes out of the front face. To
      do this, use sloping lines coming forward.</li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet">  Make all
      lines that you can see on the objects thick.</li>

	But in the sloping breadth direction, you must halve the true scale measurement. So if

     <p> When something is too heavy to lift by hand, you
can use a lever to help you lift it. If you want to lift
a heavy object, you should use a long lever and the
fulcrum should be close to the object that you want
to lift. If you give a soft or weak downwards push
on the one side of the lever, there will be a strong
upwards push on the object on the other side of the
lever.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-text-1-3 para-style-override-75">Levers can
    be used for reasons other than to gain a mechanical advantage.
    When you sweep the floor with a broom that has a long handle
    you use the broom as a lever. The long handle makes it possible
    to sweep over a large area while moving your hands only for a
    short distance. In this case the lever (the broomstick) gives
    you a <span class="char-style-override-6"><b>distance
    advantage</b></span>, although there is no <span class=
    "char-style-override-6"><b>mechanical disadvantage</b></span>.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3 para-style-override-76">Levers
    also change the <span class=

    push the one end of the blue lever below down, the other end
    moves up.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">The blue bar on this diagram
    indicates a lever that pivots around point O. The yellow bar is
    a rod that can be used to push end A of the lever. The red bar
    can only move between the two black strips. The black dots at A

    out, to think about, to plan and to prepare before you can even
    start with a project. For the next two and a half weeks, you
    will design and make a mechanical tool. You will design it in
    such a way that it solves a particular problem.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-opener">Work alone, and only at school. Your
    teacher will assess your work.</p>

    <p>Last weekend, there was an
accident just outside town. A
car lost control, went off the
road and toppled over. Two
people were trapped inside the
crashed car. They were badly
injured, but still alive. Because
the metal body of the car was
bent, the doors could not open.</p>

<p>An ambulance with <b>paramedics</b> arrived to help the trapped
people. But the paramedics could not get them out of the
crumpled car in time to give them medical treatment or to take
them to the hospital. So the two people inside the car died from
their injuries.
</p>
<p>Incidents like this are very sad. Many peoples’ lives could be saved
if it was possible to remove them from car wrecks in time to get
medical help.

<div class="aside"><p><b>Paramedics</b> are people

<p>If the paramedics had the Jaws
of Life tools with them, they
could have cut or bent the car
doors open with these tools
to remove the injured people.
Then they could have given
medical help to the injured
people, and the story would
have had a happier ending.
