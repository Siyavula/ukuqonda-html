    <p class="x--Body-Text">Next week, you will look at different
    kinds of resistors used in circuits. You will also practise
    doing calculations using the formulas in Ohm's Law.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-opener">In this chapter, you will learn how
    to use resistors in electric circuits to control a current. You
    will discover that there are different kinds of resistors for
    different purposes, and you will learn how to read the amount
    of resistance on a resistor. You will also learn about Ohm's
    Law, which relates the quantities of voltage, current and
    resistance, and you will use formulae to do calculations to
    find the values of voltage, current and resistance.</p>

    <h2>2.1 Resistors and their identification codes</h2>

    <p class="x--Head-investigation">What is resistance?</p>

    <p class="x--Body-text-1-3">Electricity flows far more easily
    through copper wire than through plastic wire, string or grass.
    Copper wire has a low resistance to electricity flow, whereas
    plastic wire has a high <span class="char-style-override-3">resistance</span>. Because electricity
    flows easily through copper wire, copper is a good <span class="char-style-override-3">conductor</span> of electricity.</p>

    <div class="frame-61">
      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent">To <span class="char-style-override-4">resist</span> something means to try
      to prevent it. If you sit in a tree and the wind blows hard,
      you can resist falling down by clinging to the branches.</p>

      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent">To <span class="char-style-override-4">conduct</span> means to allow
      something to pass through.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3">The resistance that an object,
    for example a piece of wire, offers to the flow of electricity
    can be measured.</p>

    <div class="note">
      <ul><li class="Body-bullet"><span class="char-style-override-1">&#226;&#8364;&#162;</span>
        &#160;</li>
      </ul></div>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3">When electricity flows through a
    conductor, heat is generated. Some metals, such as nickel and
    chrome, resist the flow of electricity quite strongly, and heat
    up when electricity is forced to flow through it. The heating
    elements of stoves and kettles are normally made of a mixture
    of nickel and chrome. When some metals get extremely hot, they
    <span class="char-style-override-3">emit</span> light.</p>

    <div class="frame-63">
      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent">When something <span class="char-style-override-4">emits</span> light, it is a source of
      light. A light bulb is a source of light, but a mirror is not
      a source of light as it only reflects light.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">If the resistance in a circuit is
    very low, for example when the terminals of a cell are
    connected with a piece of thick copper wire, the current will
    flow very strongly. This is called a "short circuit". It can
    result in so much heat being generated that damage is caused to
    the cell and other parts of the circuit, the conducting wires
    can melt and a fire can start.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">By adding more resistance to a
    circuit, you can control how great the current is that flows
    through the circuit. In this way, you can protect the
    components in a circuit from too much current flowing through
    them. Increasing the resistance also means the cell or battery
    powering the circuit will last longer. You can add precise
    amounts of resistance by using resistors with the required
    resistance value.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-Text para-style-override-15"><span class="char-style-override-5"><span class="Basic-Graphics-Frame"><img class="frame-37" src="Tech_English_LG_Grade9_term3_1-web-resources/image/29650.png" alt="29650.png"/></span></span></p>

    <p class="x--Head-investigation">What is a resistor?</p>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">A resistor is a specially designed
    component that is normally used in a circuit to limit the
    current. Resistors are made of materials with a high resistance
    to electricity flow, and come in the form of thin wires or
    films. Resistors also have precise resistance values that don't
    change much in different environmental conditions.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">The most commonly used resistors look
    like tubes, with two wires to connect it to the circuit. The
    symbol to show a resistor in a circuit diagram is an open
    rectangle or a zigzag line.</p>

    Circuit symbols for resistors</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3">Low-value resistors often have
    their resistance value printed on them in numbers, while
    high-value resistors are coded, using coloured bands. The first
    three bands give the value of the resistor in ohms. The
    colour-code chart on the second page of this chapter will help
    you to work out the resistance value in ohms.</p>

    <div class="frame-66">
      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent">The fourth band on a
      resistor shows the accuracy rating as a percentage. This is
      also called the "tolerance". The band is gold or silver,
      depending on the tolerance. For the circuits you will be
      building, this is not important.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3">Resistors are the most commonly
    used components in electronics, as they are useful to control
    current. You will see how they are used in the following
    weeks.</p>

    by closing or opening the circuit. There are various types of
    switches that control the circuit in different ways. In this

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Consider an automatic car gate

    direction in which the motor turns be changed? The way to do
    this is to change the direction of the current through the
    electric motor. Double-pole, double-throw switches can be used
    to reverse the direction of current through a circuit, so they
    are useful in applications such as automatic car gates. The

    <hr/><hr/><hr/><hr/><hr/><hr/><h2>3.2 Diodes</h2>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">A diode is a component with two
    terminals that can be connected in a circuit. The function of a
    diode in a circuit is to allow an electric current to flow in
    the forward direction and to block current in the opposite
    direction.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">If the anode is connected to a higher
    voltage than the cathode, the current will flow from the anode
    to the cathode. This is called "forward bias".</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">If the diode is put in the circuit
    back to front, so that the voltage at the cathode is higher
    than the voltage at the anode, the diode will not conduct
    electricity. This is called "reverse bias".</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Diodes are normally used to prevent
    damage to other components in circuits. For example, some
    components have positive and negative terminals and will be
    damaged if a current goes through them in the wrong direction.
    A diode can protect against a current flowing the wrong way if
    a battery was put in incorrectly to power the components. If
    you put batteries into a radio incorrectly, a diode will
    prevent damage to the radio.</p>

    <p class="x--caption">Figure 10: A diode</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3">Diodes vary considerably in size,
    current-carrying capacity, and reverse blocking voltage. They
    range from small diodes that can only handle 20&#160;mA with a
    reverse blockage of 30&#160;V, to large industrial diodes that
    can carry hundreds of amps and block up to thousands of volts.
    You can use a multimeter or a simple tester (battery, resistor
    and LED) to check in which direction a diode conducts.</p>

    <p class="x--Head-C para-style-override-2">Light-emitting
    diodes (LED)</p>

    <p class="x--Body-text-1-3">A light-emitting diode (LED) is a
    special kind of diode that glows when electricity passes
    through it. LEDs produce light of specific colours, based on
    the materials they are made from. For example, they can produce
    red, amber, yellow, green, blue, violet and white. The most
    common colour is red.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3">LEDs are often used to show if a
    circuit is working. Think about the small red light glowing on
    the front of a TV set that can sometimes change from red to
    amber.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3">LEDs are used as indicators in
    many devices, including calculator screens and digital
    clocks.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3">The LED will only allow current
    to pass in one direction. The cathode is normally indicated by
    a flat side on the casing and the anode is normally indicated
    by a slightly longer leg. The current required to power an LED
    is usually around 20 mA.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-text-1-3">Transistors are very important
    building blocks of modern electronic devices. They enable us to
    design smaller and cheaper electronic devices.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3">A transistor is a semiconductor
    device that consists of three layers. Each layer has its own

    <p class="x--caption">Figure 16: The circuit symbol for an npn
    transistor</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">A transistor works as a type of
    switch to turn current on and off. It can also amplify a
    current.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3">An <span class="char-style-override-3">npn</span> transistor acts as if there
    is a switch between the collector and the emitter. With a
    positive potential on the base of the transistor, the switch is
    closed. So it is an electrically controlled switch.</p>

    <div class="frame-111">
      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent">There are other types of
      transistors, for example pnp transistors that work a bit
      differently from npn transistors. But you will only work with
      npn transistors in this term.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3">Transistor is short for
    "trans-resistor" and this explains how it works. With a
    relatively small base current, the resistance between the
    collector and the emitter is changed. As the base current
    increases, the collector emitter resistance decreases.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">In Chapter 5, you will learn about
    the applications of transistors.</p>

    <p class="x--Head-investigation">A transistor circuit</p>

    <p class="x--Body-text-1-3 para-style-override-35">Suppose you
    want to make a switch that is ON or closed when you touch its
    two terminals with your finger, and OFF or open when you don't
    touch it. Look at the circuit diagram in Figure 17 for a
    touch-switch such as the one described. The purpose of this
    circuit is to light up the LED when you touch the touch-switch
    with your finger.</p>

    <div>

      </div>
    </div>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3 para-style-override-35">
    Unfortunately, this circuit won't work well, since your finger
    is a very weak conductor. In other words it has a very high
    resistance. So the current will be very small when you touch
    the switch. Therefore the LED will only emit a dim light.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3">By using a transistor, you can
    build a circuit that uses the very small current from your
    finger to switch on a larger current that passes through the
    LED, which will then emit a bright light.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3">Figure 18 shows a circuit that
    uses a transistor for this purpose. In this circuit, the touch
    switch is an "input device," the <span class="char-style-override-7">npn</span>&#160;transistor is a
    "control&#160;device," and the LED is the "output device".</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Capacitors are often used in
    electronic devices that need a carefully controlled time delay,

    <p class="x--Head-C para-style-override-2">A fire alarm: A
    circuit with a sensor and a transistor</p>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">In the next lesson, you will build the
    electronic circuit for a fire alarm. In the next chapter, you
    will use the same circuit but for a different purpose, as part
    of an automatic kettle switch. It is very important that you
    complete the circuit and that it works, as you will use it in
    the Mini-PAT in the weeks that follow.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">The type of circuit you will build is
    used very often to switch an <span class="char-style-override-7">output device</span> on and off without
    using a switch. Instead of a switch controlled by hand, this
    type of circuit uses an <span class="char-style-override-7">input sensor</span> in combination with
    a transistor to switch the output device on or off <span class="char-style-override-7">automatically</span>, depending on the
    measurement of something by the input sensor.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3 para-style-override-45">This type
    of circuit is called a <span class="char-style-override-7">control circuit</span> since one
    circuit controls another circuit. In the case where a
    transistor is used with a sensor such as an LDR, the
    base-emitter current controls the larger collector-emitter
    current.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3 para-style-override-45">Note that
    resistor 2 and the input sensor may have to change places
    depending on what relationship between the resistance of the
    input sensor and the output device you want.</p>

    <div class="Basic-Text-Frame frame-178">
      <p class="x--Body-opener">If you try to build a more
      complicated circuit by connecting components using conducting
      wire and crocodile clips, many wires will cross one another
      and the circuit will be messy, looking like a tangled bunch
      of ropes.</p>

      <p class="x--Body-opener">To make a complicated circuit in a
      neater and smaller way, most circuits are built on boards
      such as "bread boards", "strip boards", or "printed circuit
      boards" (PCBs).</p>

      <p class="x--Body-opener">Figure 10 below shows a simple LED
      circuit, such as the one you built in section 5.1, but here
      it is built on a strip board. Notice that there are no
      connecting wires used to build this circuit! This is because
      at the bottom of the strip board there are parallel copper
      strips connecting the holes in each column. This makes it
      possible to construct a circuit without using wire.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="Basic-Text-Frame frame-182">
      <p class="x--Body-opener">Figure 11 shows one possible plan
      of how to arrange the simple LED circuit on a strip board.
      The copper strips are at the bottom of a strip board, and not
      visible from the top. Therefore the copper strips on the
      drawing of the layout were drawn with hatching, to show that
      you cannot really see them from the top.</p>

      <p class="x--Body-opener">The arrows on Figure 11 are drawn
      to help you understand how current flows through the copper
      strips at the back of the strip board. The current flows in
      the direction of the arrows.</p>

      <p class="x--Body-opener">The connectors of the components
      are soldered to the copper strips at the bottom of the strip
      board. This is to ensure that they make proper electrical
      contact with the copper strips.</p>

      <p class="x--Body-opener">Soldering is done with lead,
      because lead is a good electrical conductor and has a low
      melting point, so it is easy and quick to melt it with a
      soldering iron.</p>

      <p class="x--Body-opener">Bread boards and printed circuit
      boards are other types of boards used to build complicated
      circuits. They also have copper connections at the back, but
      these connections are arranged in a different way than on a
      strip board.</p>

      <p class="x--Body-opener">With a breadboard it is not
      necessary to solder connections, since each hole in the

      proper electrical contact.</p>

      <p class="x--Body-opener">Almost all manufactured electronic
      devices use printed circuit boards, where the copper
      connections at the back can be made in any pattern. This

    a photovoltaic cell, can also be used as a sensor. A sensor
    "senses" something such as temperature, or light, just as your
    body's senses do. A variable resistor is also a control device,
    but it is not a sensor, because it is a device for which the

    circuit for the fire alarm that you built in Chapter 5 can be
    used for different applications where a small input current
    from an input sensor has to switch on a circuit with a larger
    current for an output device. There is also a variable resistor
    so that the user can determine at what level of light or
    temperature (for example) the output device should be switched
    on or off.</p>

    <p class="x--Head-extension">An alternative to the kettle
    swicth project: Designing and building a circuit continuity
    tester</p>

    <div class="Basic-Text-Frame frame-205">
      <p class="x--Body-opener">Your teacher may decide to let you
      do the following project instead of designing and building an
      automatic kettle switch.</p>

      <p class="x--Body-opener">Often when people have to connect
      wiresin electric circuits, there are so manywires that it is
      difficult to know whichtwo wire ends are of the same
      wire.</p>

      <p class="x--Body-opener">It would help to have a device
      thatshows whether two wire ends areconnected or not. This is
      whata "circuit continuity tester" does.</p>

      <div>
        <div class="frame-7"><img class="frame-204" src="Tech_English_LG_Grade9_term3_1-web-resources/image/Tech2_gr9_ch6_fig8_opt.png" alt="Tech2_gr9_ch6_fig8.tif"/></div>

    </div>

    <div class="Basic-Text-Frame frame-207">
      <p class="x--Body-opener">A circuit continuity tester is
      actually an open circuit. The circuit can only be closed by
      the two wire ends thatyou are testing. Use the two test leads
      of the circuitcontinuity tester to touch the two wire ends
      that youwant to test. If there is a path for current to
      beconducted between the two wire ends, this willcomplete the
      circuit and a light or a buzzer on thecircuit continuity
      tester will be activated.</p>

      <div class="frame-206">
        <p class="x--Body-box-heading">Safety warning:</p>

        <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent">First switch off the power
        supply before you do a test such as this one.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="Basic-Text-Frame frame-208">
      <p class="x--Body-opener">Note that a circuit continuity
      tester cannot tell you whether the two wire ends are of the
      same wire. It can only tell you whether there is a path for
      current to be conducted between the two wire ends, in other
      words whether the two wire ends are electrically connected.
      But if you know that there are no splitting or joining of
      wires in between the two wire ends, then the wire ends can
      only be electrically connected if they are of the same
      wire.</p>

      <p class="x--Body-opener">If you design and build a circuit
      continuity tester as your project, think about the
      following:</p>

      <ul><li class="x--Body-opener-bullet"><span class="char-style-override-2">&#226;&#8364;&#162;</span> It
        should be easy to let the test leads of the circuit
        continuity tester make proper electrical contact with the
        wire ends.</li>

        <li class="x--Body-opener-bullet"><span class="char-style-override-2">&#226;&#8364;&#162;</span> The
        tester should be small.</li>

        <li class="x--Body-opener-bullet"><span class="char-style-override-2">&#226;&#8364;&#162;</span> The
        tester should be protected from shocks, for example if it
        gets dropped.</li>

        <li class="x--Body-opener-bullet"><span class="char-style-override-2">&#226;&#8364;&#162;</span> The
        tester should be protected from water, since water can
        cause a short circuit.</li>
