    <h2>1.1 Revision 1: Component symbols</h2>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">"Components" are the parts that we
    connect in an electric circuit.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Do you remember the symbols for
    cells, lamps and switches?</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Do you remember the difference
    between joining components in series and in parallel? Let's see
    what you can remember.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">You have already learnt that an
    electric circuit is a closed path in which a current flows.</p>

    <div class="note">
      <p>The simplest circuit has:
</p>
     <ul><li class="x--Body-text-bullet"> a power
        source such as a cell,</li>

        <li class="x--Body-text-bullet"> a
        conductor, and</li>

        <li class="x--Body-text-bullet"> a load
        that provides resistance, such as a lamp.</li>
      </ul></div>

    <h2>Cells in series</h2>

    <p class="x--Body-text-1-3">Two or more cells can be connected
    <b>in series</b> to
    increase the voltage in the circuit. Figure 2 below shows two
    cells connected in series in a circuit. The positive terminal
    of cell A is connected to the lamp.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">The negative terminal of cell A is
    connected to the positive terminal of cell B, and the negative
    terminal of cell B is connected to the other terminal of the
    lamp.</p>

    <div class="aside">
      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent"><b>In series</b> means the cells are
      connected end-to-end, and the current flows through each cell
      in turn.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-investigation-hanging-a-">(b) The total
    current in the circuit is 10 A. If lamp 1 has a current of 4 A

    <hr/><h2>Switches in series
    and parallel</h2>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">In a circuit with one switch, the
    switch controls whether the current flows through the circuit
    or not. If the switch is open, no current flows, as the circuit
    is not completed. The closed switch allows the current to
    flow.</p>

    <h2>Switches in

    <p class="x--Body-indent">In the circuit below, there are two
    switches in series. This gives us four different switch

    <p class="x--Body-Text">In this lesson, you will set up simple
    circuits, revising what you learnt about setting up circuits in
    Grade 8.</p>

    <h4><span class="char-style-override-3">You will need the following for this

    <h2>2.1 Resistors and their identification codes</h2>

    <h3>What is resistance?</h3>

    <p class="x--Body-text-1-3">Electricity flows far more easily
    through copper wire than through plastic wire, string or grass.
    Copper wire has a low resistance to electricity flow, whereas
    plastic wire has a high <b>resistance</b>. Because electricity
    flows easily through copper wire, copper is a good <b>conductor</b> of electricity.</p>

    <div class="aside">
      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent">To <b>resist</b> something means to try
      to prevent it. If you sit in a tree and the wind blows hard,
      you can resist falling down by clinging to the branches.</p>

      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent">To <b>conduct</b> means to allow
      something to pass through.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3">The resistance that an object,
    for example a piece of wire, offers to the flow of electricity
    can be measured.</p>

    <div class="note"><p>Resistance is measured in ohms. We use the
symbol

      &#8486;</p></div>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3">When electricity flows through a
    conductor, heat is generated. Some metals, such as nickel and
    chrome, resist the flow of electricity quite strongly, and heat
    up when electricity is forced to flow through it. The heating
    elements of stoves and kettles are normally made of a mixture
    of nickel and chrome. When some metals get extremely hot, they
    <b>emit</b> light.</p>

    <div class="aside">
      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent">When something <b>emits</b> light, it is a source of
      light. A light bulb is a source of light, but a mirror is not
      a source of light as it only reflects light.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">If the resistance in a circuit is
    very low, for example when the terminals of a cell are
    connected with a piece of thick copper wire, the current will
    flow very strongly. This is called a "short circuit". It can
    result in so much heat being generated that damage is caused to
    the cell and other parts of the circuit, the conducting wires
    can melt and a fire can start.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">By adding more resistance to a
    circuit, you can control how great the current is that flows
    through the circuit. In this way, you can protect the
    components in a circuit from too much current flowing through
    them. Increasing the resistance also means the cell or battery
    powering the circuit will last longer. You can add precise
    amounts of resistance by using resistors with the required
    resistance value.</p>


    <h3>What is a resistor?</h3>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">A resistor is a specially designed
    component that is normally used in a circuit to limit the
    current. Resistors are made of materials with a high resistance
    to electricity flow, and come in the form of thin wires or
    films. Resistors also have precise resistance values that don't
    change much in different environmental conditions.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">The most commonly used resistors look
    like tubes, with two wires to connect it to the circuit. The
    symbol to show a resistor in a circuit diagram is an open
    rectangle or a zigzag line.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3">Low-value resistors often have
    their resistance value printed on them in numbers, while
    high-value resistors are coded, using coloured bands. The first
    three bands give the value of the resistor in ohms. The
    colour-code chart on the second page of this chapter will help
    you to work out the resistance value in ohms.</p>

    <div class="aside">
      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent">The fourth band on a
      resistor shows the accuracy rating as a percentage. This is
      also called the "tolerance". The band is gold or silver,
      depending on the tolerance. For the circuits you will be
      building, this is not important.</p>

    double-throw switches (DPDT)</h4>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">A double-pole, double-throw switch
    (DPDT) is like two SPDT switches with their switch levers
    attached to each other. There are two input circuits, and for
    each input circuit, there are two possible output circuits.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">In the symbol below, the dotted line
    shows that the switches operate together.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Consider an automatic car gate
    powered by an electric motor. To open the gate, the motor
    should turn in one direction. To close the gate, the motor
    should turn in the <span class="char-style-override-7">opposite</span> direction. How can the
    direction in which the motor turns be changed? The way to do
    this is to change the direction of the current through the
    electric motor. Double-pole, double-throw switches can be used
    to reverse the direction of current through a circuit, so they
    are useful in applications such as automatic car gates. The
    circuit diagram below shows how a DPDT switch can change the
    direction of current through an electric motor.</p>

     <hr/><h2>3.2 Diodes</h2>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">A diode is a component with two
    terminals that can be connected in a circuit. The function of a
    diode in a circuit is to allow an electric current to flow in
    the forward direction and to block current in the opposite
    direction.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">If the anode is connected to a higher
    voltage than the cathode, the current will flow from the anode
    to the cathode. This is called "forward bias".</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">If the diode is put in the circuit
    back to front, so that the voltage at the cathode is higher
    than the voltage at the anode, the diode will not conduct
    electricity. This is called "reverse bias".</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Diodes are normally used to prevent
    damage to other components in circuits. For example, some
    components have positive and negative terminals and will be
    damaged if a current goes through them in the wrong direction.
    A diode can protect against a current flowing the wrong way if
    a battery was put in incorrectly to power the components. If
    you put batteries into a radio incorrectly, a diode will
    prevent damage to the radio.</p>

    range from small diodes that can only handle 20&#160;mA with a
    reverse blockage of 30&#160;V, to large industrial diodes that
    can carry hundreds of amps and block up to thousands of volts.
    You can use a multimeter or a simple tester (battery, resistor
    and LED) to check in which direction a diode conducts.</p>

    <h4>Light-emitting
    diodes (LED)</h4>

    <p class="x--Body-text-1-3">A light-emitting diode (LED) is a
    special kind of diode that glows when electricity passes
    through it. LEDs produce light of specific colours, based on
    the materials they are made from. For example, they can produce
    red, amber, yellow, green, blue, violet and white. The most
    common colour is red.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3">LEDs are often used to show if a
    circuit is working. Think about the small red light glowing on
    the front of a TV set that can sometimes change from red to
    amber.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3">LEDs are used as indicators in
    many devices, including calculator screens and digital
    clocks.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3">The LED will only allow current
    to pass in one direction. The cathode is normally indicated by
    a flat side on the casing and the anode is normally indicated
    by a slightly longer leg. The current required to power an LED
    is usually around 20 mA.</p>

    household lighting is being replaced by LEDs. They are
    replacing light bulbs because they are more efficient and use
    much less electric energy. They also last for a long time.</p>

      <h2>3.3 Transistors</h2>
    <p class="x--Body-text-1-3">Transistors are very important
    building blocks of modern electronic devices. They enable us to
    design smaller and cheaper electronic devices.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3">A transistor is a semiconductor
    device that consists of three layers. Each layer has its own
    connection point with a specific name: <b>collector</b>, <b>base</b> and <b>emitter</b>.</p>

    <figure>       <div class="frame-7"><img class="frame-109" src="Tech_English_LG_Grade9_term3_1-web-resources/image/Tech2_gr9_ch3_fig15_opt.jpeg" alt="Tech2_gr9_ch3_fig15.tif"/></div>

<figcaption>
    <p class="x--caption">Figure 16: The circuit symbol for an npn
    transistor</p>
</figcaption></figure>
    <p class="x--Body-indent">A transistor works as a type of
    switch to turn current on and off. It can also amplify a
    current.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3">An <b>npn</b> transistor acts as if there
    is a switch between the collector and the emitter. With a
    positive potential on the base of the transistor, the switch is
    closed. So it is an electrically controlled switch.</p>

    <div class="aside">
      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent">There are other types of
      transistors, for example pnp transistors that work a bit
      differently from npn transistors. But you will only work with
      npn transistors in this term.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3">Transistor is short for
    "trans-resistor" and this explains how it works. With a
    relatively small base current, the resistance between the
    collector and the emitter is changed. As the base current
    increases, the collector emitter resistance decreases.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">In Chapter 5, you will learn about
    the applications of transistors.</p>

    <h3>A transistor circuit</h3>

    <p class="x--Body-text-1-3 para-style-override-35">Suppose you
    want to make a switch that is ON or closed when you touch its
    two terminals with your finger, and OFF or open when you don't
    touch it. Look at the circuit diagram in Figure 17 for a
    touch-switch such as the one described. The purpose of this
    circuit is to light up the LED when you touch the touch-switch
    with your finger.</p>

    <figure>
      <div class="frame-7"><img class="frame-112" src="Tech_English_LG_Grade9_term3_1-web-resources/image/Tech2_Gr9_Ch3_Fig17_opt.jpeg" alt="Tech2_Gr9_Ch3_Fig17.tif"/></div>

        <p class="x--caption">Figure 17: A simple touch-switch
        circuit that will not work well</p>
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3 para-style-override-35">
    Unfortunately, this circuit won't work well, since your finger
    is a very weak conductor. In other words it has a very high
    resistance. So the current will be very small when you touch
    the switch. Therefore the LED will only emit a dim light.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3">By using a transistor, you can
    build a circuit that uses the very small current from your
    finger to switch on a larger current that passes through the
    LED, which will then emit a bright light.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3">Figure 18 shows a circuit that
    uses a transistor for this purpose. In this circuit, the touch
    switch is an "input device," the <span class="char-style-override-7">npn</span>&#160;transistor is a
    "control&#160;device," and the LED is the "output device".</p>

    <div class="aside">
      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent">A transistor uses a small
      current circuit to switch on a larger current circuit. This

   <h2>4.3 Capacitors</h2>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">The main function of a capacitor is to
    store electric charge. A capacitor consists of two metal plates
    separated by an insulator called a dielectric. The ability of a
    capacitor to store electric charge is called its
    capacitance.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Capacitance is measured in farad. The
    symbol "C" is used for capacitance. B<a id="Anchor-14"/>ecause the farad is such a large unit,
    practical values usually have the prefixes m (milli-),

    the time delay.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">In the next lesson, you will build the

    will use the same circuit but for a different purpose, as part
    of an automatic kettle switch. It is very important that you
    complete the circuit and that it works, as you will use it in
    the Mini-PAT in the weeks that follow.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">The type of circuit you will build is
    used very often to switch an <span class="char-style-override-7">output device</span> on and off without
    using a switch. Instead of a switch controlled by hand, this
    type of circuit uses an <span class="char-style-override-7">input sensor</span> in combination with
    a transistor to switch the output device on or off <span class="char-style-override-7">automatically</span>, depending on the
    measurement of something by the input sensor.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3 para-style-override-45">This type
    of circuit is called a <span class="char-style-override-7">control circuit</span> since one
    circuit controls another circuit. In the case where a

    current.</p>

    <h3>Further reading: Boards on which
    more complicated circuits are built</h3>

     
      <p class="x--Body-opener">If you try to build a more
      complicated circuit by connecting components using conducting
      wire and crocodile clips, many wires will cross one another
      and the circuit will be messy, looking like a tangled bunch
      of ropes.</p>

      <p class="x--Body-opener">To make a complicated circuit in a
      neater and smaller way, most circuits are built on boards
      such as "bread boards", "strip boards", or "printed circuit
      boards" (PCBs).</p>

      <p class="x--Body-opener">Figure 10 below shows a simple LED
      circuit, such as the one you built in section 5.1, but here
      it is built on a strip board. Notice that there are no
      connecting wires used to build this circuit! This is because
      at the bottom of the strip board there are parallel copper
      strips connecting the holes in each column. This makes it
      possible to construct a circuit without using wire.</p>
   

    <figure>

      simple LED circuit on a strip board</span></p></figcaption></figure>
   

 
      <p class="x--Body-opener">Figure 11 shows one possible plan
      of how to arrange the simple LED circuit on a strip board.
      The copper strips are at the bottom of a strip board, and not
      visible from the top. Therefore the copper strips on the
      drawing of the layout were drawn with hatching, to show that
      you cannot really see them from the top.</p>

      <p class="x--Body-opener">The arrows on Figure 11 are drawn
      to help you understand how current flows through the copper
      strips at the back of the strip board. The current flows in
      the direction of the arrows.</p>

      <p class="x--Body-opener">The connectors of the components
      are soldered to the copper strips at the bottom of the strip
      board. This is to ensure that they make proper electrical
      contact with the copper strips.</p>

      <p class="x--Body-opener">Soldering is done with lead,
      because lead is a good electrical conductor and has a low
      melting point, so it is easy and quick to melt it with a
      soldering iron.</p>

      <p class="x--Body-opener">Bread boards and printed circuit
      boards are other types of boards used to build complicated
      circuits. They also have copper connections at the back, but
      these connections are arranged in a different way than on a
      strip board.</p>

      <p class="x--Body-opener">With a breadboard it is not
      necessary to solder connections, since each hole in the
      breadboard has a spring that grips the wire tightly to make
      proper electrical contact.</p>

      <p class="x--Body-opener">Almost all manufactured electronic
      devices use printed circuit boards, where the copper
      connections at the back can be made in any pattern. This
      makes it possible to make complicated circuits that are very
      small.</p>

    Investigate: A circuit with an input sensor, control knob,
    transistor and output device(15 minutes)</h3>

    <p class="x--Body-text-1-3 para-style-override-51">A
    <span class="char-style-override-7">sensor</span> is a control
    device that can have a <span class="char-style-override-7">variable effect</span>. A switch can
    only be open (infinitely large resistance) or closed (zero
    resistance), so a switch is not a sensor. Devices such as
    thermistors and LDRs can have different resistances, depending
    on the temperature or amount of light. They can therefore be
    used as sensors. A device that can generate a voltage, such as
    a photovoltaic cell, can also be used as a sensor. A sensor
    "senses" something such as temperature, or light, just as your
    body's senses do. A variable resistor is also a control device,
    but it is not a sensor, because it is a device for which the
    user can <span class="char-style-override-7">set</span> the
    resistance.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3 para-style-override-51">The
    circuit for the fire alarm that you built in Chapter 5 can be
    used for different applications where a small input current
    from an input sensor has to switch on a circuit with a larger
    current for an output device. There is also a variable resistor
    so that the user can determine at what level of light or

    <p class="x--Body-text-1-3 para-style-override-53">A kettle
    uses electricity at a rate 30 times higher than a normal light
    bulb. A lot of electricity can be saved if a kettle is used
    more effectively.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3 para-style-override-53">If a
    kettle keeps boiling without being switched off, it uses
    electricity unnecessarily. This leads to a waste of

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3 para-style-override-53">If you
    drink your tea or coffee without cold milk, you do not want
    boiling hot water(100  &#176;C), since it will burn you.
    So it is a waste of electricity and time to bring the water to
    boiling point (100  &#176;C). Most of the time, a kettle
    only needs to heat water to a temperature of about 75
    &#176;C. If the kettle keeps heating the water to a
    temperature of 100  &#176;C, it is a waste of
    electricity.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-investigation-hanging">1. What is the purpose
    of the switch you will be designing?</p>

    <p class="x--Body-investigation-hanging">Hint: Think about how
    easy it is for people to do things, the impact on the
    environment, and costs involved. </p>
    <hr/><p class="x--Body--above"><b>Specifications</b></p>

    <p class="x--Body-investigation-hanging">2. What parts should
    the device have where the user must press or turn something by
    hand? </p>
     <hr/><p class="x--Body-investigation-hanging">3. Are there part(s)
    of the device that would sometimes be moved by the user,and
    other times be moved automatically? </p>
    <hr/><p class="x--Body-investigation-hanging">4. How should the
    moving parts of your switch work? For example, what should
    cause it to move one way, and what should cause it to move the
    other way?Use names for the different moving parts, as well as
    for the other parts thatwill make the moving parts move or stop
    them from moving. </p>
     <hr/><p class="x--Body-investigation-hanging">5. What type of
    electrical component can generate the automatic movement that
    your device has to perform? This component will be the output
    device in the control circuit on page 74. </p>
    <hr/><p class="x--Body-investigation-hanging">6. Does your device
    need a container or supporting structure to keep all the parts
    together? What type of container or structure do you think will
    work well? </p>

    <h3>
    Evaluate as a team: Learn from one another's designs to make a
    better design together (60 minutes)</h3>

    <p class="x--Body-investigation-hanging">1. Each team member
    should explain his or her designto the rest of the team, and
    the others should askquestions if they don't understand
    something.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-investigation-hanging">2. After everyone has
    explained their designs, youshould make a list of the
    advantages anddisadvantages of all the designs.</p><hr/>

    <div class="aside">
      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent"><b>There is no such thing as a perfect
      design!</b> For example, you can make a complicated design
      that will work very well, but that will be expensive and
      difficult to build. Or you can make a simple and cheap design
      that works, but is not strong enough.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="x--Body--above"><b>Learn from the different designs that
    different people made</b></p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Don't throw an idea away too quickly
    even if there is a problem with it. First sketch and explain it
    to the others. This idea can lead to another better idea. If
    everyone throws their ideas away too quickly, there will be no
    ideas on the table to work with. Design teams work well when
    they separate the work into two stages:</p>
    <ul><li class="x--Body-text-bullet">
         First
        generate ideas, sketch and explain them,without anyone
        saying anything negative aboutthe ideas.

        
      </li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet para-style-override-1">
        

        <div class="frame-202"/>Once you have several ideas on
        the table, startthinking about how and whether the
        differentideas will work or not. Don't talk about
        "Mary'sdesign" or "Sipho's design". Rather talk
        about"Design C" or "Design B". Once someone has puta design
        on the table, you talk about the design.You do not talk
        about the person. You evaluatethe designs. You do not
        evaluate yourself orsomeone else.

        
      </li>
    </ul>
    
<div class="aside">
          <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent">If someone makes a
          negative remark at this stage, you should say
          <span class="char-style-override-7">"Red flag! No
          negative remarks at this stage."</span></p>
        </div> 
    <div class="aside">
          <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent">Saying "Mary's made a
          bad design" or "Sipho's is much better", for example,
          will hurt someone's feelings or make others feel proud or
          arrogant. If someone says "Mary's design ...", you should
          say <span class="char-style-override-7">"Red flag! We
          call thatDesign C."</span></p>
        </div>
    <p class="x--Body-investigation-hanging">3. Now combine
    different ideas from different designs into one better design.
    Your team will only succeed at this if you talk and sketch
    together "creatively". Being creative means "playing with
    ideas".</p>

    <p class="x--Body-investigation-hanging para-style-override-19">To
    communicate well and to be creative, you have to make many
    rough sketches. Do that in the space provided below. Include
    labels and notes to help explain the sketches.  </p>

</div>
    <p class="x--Body-investigation-hanging">4. Now each person
    should make their own sketches of the improved design that the
    team made together. Once again, show labels and notes to
    explain the sketches.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-investigation-hanging">Make at least two
    sketches, so that both the whole design and hidden detail can
    be seen. You might want to draw the design from different view
    points, or draw a few parts on their own.(4)</p>

    Make individually: 2D Working drawing and 3D drawings of your
    design(60 minutes)</h3>

    <p class="x--Body-investigation-hanging">1. Make a 2D working
    drawing of your design in first angle orthographic projection.
    It should be drawn to scale and show as much detail as
    possible. Show dimensions and the scale. Show all hidden
    details. </p>

    <h3>Homework: Planning to make and
    gathering materials</h3>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">Make lists of the materials and tools
    you will need to build a model of your automatic kettle switch
    next week. You need to include the materials you will need to
    build the output device for the control circuit that you will
    later connect to your model of the switch. (Look back at your
    answer to question 5 on page 78.)</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">If there are any materials on your
    list that are not available at school, gather waste materials
    that you can use instead and bring it to school next week.
    <span class="char-style-override-7">If you do not do this, you
    won't be able to build a model of your design.</span></p>

 
    <h2>Week 3 </h2>

    <h3>Make
    and test your prototype of the switch(120 minutes)</h3>

    <p class="x--Body-investigation-hanging">1. Work alone to build
    a model of your design forthe switch. A model of a new design
    is calleda <b>prototype</b>.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-investigation-hanging">2. Work alone to build
    the output device for thecontrol circuit that you will later
    connect toyour switch.</p>

    <div class="aside">
      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent">Designers and engineers
      usually make many <b>prototypes</b> before the design
      is good enough to start manufacturing and selling it. Each
      prototype is an attempt to improve on the previous one.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="x--Body-investigation-hanging">3. Test your model
    with a simple circuit consistingof a battery and the electric
    output device thatyou made.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-investigation-hanging">4. Test your model by
    connecting it to the control circuit that you made inChapter
    5.</p>

    <p class="T-ques-a-">(a) Before you connect the control circuit
    to any model, your team should test the control circuit as you
    did before, see page 64, because some of the connections may
    have come loose.</p>

    <p class="T-ques-a-">(b) To test your automatic kettle switch,
    you can use a thumb tack pressed into an eraser that you heat
    by rubbing it on a piece of wood or plastic for a minute.</p>

    <p class="T-ques-a-">(c) If you were not able to build a
    control circuit successfully in Chapter 5, you can use the
    simple circuit discussed in question 3 above to test your model
    of the switch.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-investigation-hanging">5. You will probably
    find that your model does not work the first time you test it.
    This is normal! Most new things that people design don't work
    the first time they test it. Try to find out what's wrong, and
    then go back and fix it before you test it again.</p>

    <p class="x--Body--above">Your teacher will give you marks for
    the following:</p>

    <ul><li class="x--Body-text-bullet"> You
      brought all the materials needed to make a model of your
      design. </li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet"> You
      connected your model to the simple circuit with the output
      device,and used a good method to test it. </li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet"> After you

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet"> You used
      the list to fix or improve your model. </li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet"> You tested
      your model again, writing down the problems, and going

    <p class="x--Body-indent">You need to keep a record of all your
    testing and improvements on your model, otherwise you will not

    <p class="x--Head-extension">An alternative to the kettle
    swicth project: Designing and building a circuit continuity
    tester</p>

     
      <p class="x--Body-opener">Your teacher may decide to let you
      do the following project instead of designing and building an
      automatic kettle switch.</p>

      <p class="x--Body-opener">Often when people have to connect
      wiresin electric circuits, there are so manywires that it is
      difficult to know whichtwo wire ends are of the same
      wire.</p>

      <p class="x--Body-opener">It would help to have a device
      thatshows whether two wire ends areconnected or not. This is
      whata "circuit continuity tester" does.</p>

      <div>
        <div class="frame-7"><img class="frame-204" src="Tech_English_LG_Grade9_term3_1-web-resources/image/Tech2_gr9_ch6_fig8_opt.png" alt="Tech2_gr9_ch6_fig8.tif"/></div>

        <div class="Basic-Text-Frame">
          <p class="x--caption">Figure 8</p>
        </div>
     
    </div> 

    
      <p class="x--Body-opener">A circuit continuity tester is
      actually an open circuit. The circuit can only be closed by
      the two wire ends thatyou are testing. Use the two test leads
      of the circuitcontinuity tester to touch the two wire ends
      that youwant to test. If there is a path for current to
      beconducted between the two wire ends, this willcomplete the
      circuit and a light or a buzzer on thecircuit continuity
      tester will be activated.</p>

      <div class="aside">
        <p class="x--Body-box-heading"><b>Safety warning:</b></p>

        <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent">First switch off the power
        supply before you do a test such as this one.</p>
      </div>
  

   
      <p class="x--Body-opener">Note that a circuit continuity
      tester cannot tell you whether the two wire ends are of the
      same wire. It can only tell you whether there is a path for
      current to be conducted between the two wire ends, in other
      words whether the two wire ends are electrically connected.
      But if you know that there are no splitting or joining of
      wires in between the two wire ends, then the wire ends can
      only be electrically connected if they are of the same
      wire.</p>

      <p class="x--Body-opener">If you design and build a circuit
      continuity tester as your project, think about the
      following:</p>

      <ul><li class="x--Body-opener-bullet"> It
        should be easy to let the test leads of the circuit
        continuity tester make proper electrical contact with the
        wire ends.</li>

        <li class="x--Body-opener-bullet"> The
        tester should be small.</li>

        <li class="x--Body-opener-bullet"> The
        tester should be protected from shocks, for example if it
        gets dropped.</li>

        <li class="x--Body-opener-bullet"> The
        tester should be protected from water, since water can
        cause a short circuit.</li>
      </ul> 

 
      <p class="x--Body-opener">A few ideas for building a circuit
      continuity tester are shown in the photos below.</p>
