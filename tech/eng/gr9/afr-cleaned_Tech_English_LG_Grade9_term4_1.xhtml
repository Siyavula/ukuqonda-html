  <h1>7 Beskerming van metale </h1>
    
    <p class="x--Body-opener--1-3-">In graad 7 en 8 het jy geleer om metale as 
<b>ysterhoudend</b> en
<b>nie-ysterhoudend</b> te klassifiseer. In hierdie hoofstuk gaan ons die
klassifisering van metale hersien.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-opener--1-3-">Jy gaan leer hoe om metale te beskerm en in stand te hou
met behulp van die volgende metodes: verf, galvanisering en
elektroplatering. As ons materiale en toerusting in stand hou en
herwin, sal dit mynbou verminder. En soos jy teen hierdie tyd weet,
is mynbou skadelik vir die omgewing.
</p>

    <div class="aside">
      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent"><b>Ysterhoudend</b> verwys na die
teenwoordigheid van yster
(die element op die periodieke
tabel) in ’n metaal, byvoorbeeld
staal. Ysterhoudende metale
het oor die algemeen ’n
geneigdheid om met suurstof
te verbind en hierdie proses
word "oksidasie" genoem.</p>

      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent"><b>Nie-ysterhoudende</b> metale
soos aluminium, koper,
sink en goud, bevat geen
ystermolekules nie. Hierdie
metale is oor die algemeen
duurder as ysterhoudende
metale.</p>

    <p class="x--Body--above">Alhoewel metale (soos wat ons hulle oor die algemeen waarneem) baie sterk is,
vergaan hulle ook oor tyd. Roes is een van die mees algemene maniere waarop
metale vergaan. Plante en diere gaan dood, verander in kompos en keer terug na
die grond. Wanneer metale roes, breek hulle in kleiner deeltjies af en keer ook
terug in die grond in. Soos jy teen hierdie tyd weet, word metale oorspronklik uit
die grond gehaal deur mynbou.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Maar wat veroorsaak roes? Wanneer ’n metaal met suurstof reageer, vind daar ’n
chemiese reaksie plaas wat ons oksidasie noem. Die gevolg van oksidasie is roes.
Ysterhoudende metale het nie weerstand teen roes nie. Hierdie reaksie vind baie
vinniger plaas wanneer daar sout of sekere sure in die lug is. Metale by die see
roes oor die algemeen baie vinniger as metale in die binneland (sien figuur 3).</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Daar is egter goeie nuus. Daar is verskeie maniere om metale teen roes te
beskerm. Die goedkoopste manier om ysterhoudende metale teen roes te beskerm,
is om die metaal te verf.</p>

<figcaption>Figuur 3: ’n Geroeste motor by die kus</figcaption>
</figure>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Wat is die regte manier om metaal te verf? Dit hang af of die metaal splinternuut
is en of dit reeds geroes is.</p>

<figcaption>Figuur 5: Skuurpapier</figcaption>
</figure>

<p class="x--Body-indent">Indien dit ’n splinternuwe stuk metaal is wat nog nooit geverf is nie, sal
die metaal se oppervlak glad wees. Dit is dan beter om die metaal oppervlak
eers effens grof te maak. Verf sukkel om aan gladde oppervlaktes te kleef en
daarom gebruik ons ’n staalborsel (figuur 4) of skuurpapier (figuur 5) om die
oppervlak growwer te maak. Daarna moet jy seker maak dat daar geen stof op
die oppervlakte agterbly nie. Gebruik ’n skoon lap om die stof van die metaal af
te vee. Dan verf jy een laag (of verkieslik twee lae) onderlaag op. Die onderlaag
beskerm die metaal en dit moontlik vir die mooi bo-laag verf om aan die metaal se
oppervlak te kleef. Laastens, sodra die onderlaag droog is, kan jy uiteindelik die bo-
laag verf.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3">Om geroesde stukke metaal te verf, is bietjie
meer werk. Eerstens moet mens van soveel roes as
moontlik probeer ontslae raak. Indien daar ou verf
is wat afskilfer, moet mens dit ook verwyder. Mens
gebruik ’n staalborsel en skuurpapier om dit te
doen. Dit is moeilik om van alle roes ontslae te raak,
daarom moet mens n spesiale onderlaag opsit wat
die oksidasieproses keer. Indien jy nie so ’n onderlaag
opsit nie, kleef die metaal net eenvoudig aan die roes
onder die verf vas en die verf skilfer sommer gou af.</p>

    <div class="aside">
      <p class="x--Body-box-heading">Belangrike dinge om in
ag te neem wanneer jy
verf:</p>

      <p class="x--Body-box-numbers">1. Wag tot die laag verf wat
jy aanvanklik geverf het
heeltemal droog is, voordat
jy die volgende laag verf.</p>

      <p class="x--Body-box-numbers">2. Maak altyd seker dat die
oppervlak wat jy wil verf,
heeltemal skoon is. Daar
moet geen stof, water of
olie daarop wees nie. Stof,
water en olie verhoed ook
dat verf aan die oppervlak
kleef.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3">Met party soorte roeswerende onderlae moet
mens nog ’n ekstra onderlaag bo-op dit ook verf voor
mens die bo-laag kan verf. Daarom moet mens altyd
die instruksies lees op die spesifieke produk wat jy
gebruik. Wanneer mens al die onderlae geverf het,
kan jy die bo-laag verf. Nou weet jy hoe om geroesde
voorwerpe te herstel en mooi te maak, in plaas van
om dit weg te gooi!</p>

</figure>

    <div class="note">
      <p>Benewens om metale te verf, kan mens ook
ysterhoudende metaal met ’n dun lagie sink bedek
om dit teen roes te beskerm. Hierdie proses staan
bekend as <b>galvanisering.</b>
</p>

<p>Sink oksideer of roes ook, maar die sink reageer
met die suurstof, waterstof en koolstofdioksied
in die lug en verander dan na sinkkarbonaat.
</p>
<p>Zinc carbonate is quite tough and consequently
it protects the metal underneath it. If the zinc
carbonate layer gets damaged, more zinc carbonate
forms. This can repeat until there is no zinc left on
the metal. Then the metal will start to rust.
</p>
<p>Sinkkarbonaat is baie gehard en gevolglik
beskerm dit die metaal daaronder. Indien die
sinkkarbonaatlaag skade opdoen, vorm daar net
eenvoudig nog ’n laag sinkkarbonaat. Hierdie proses
hou aan tot daar nie meer sink op die metaal oor is
nie. Dan eers sal die metaal begin roes.
</p>
<p>Die beteken dat galvanisering slegs die roes-proses
van ysterhoudende metale uitstel. Dit voorkom nie
die roesproses nie. As jy metaal ordentlik en vir
’n lang tyd wil beskerm is dit beter om die metaal
te galvaniseer &#233;n te verf, soos hulle deesdae met
motors doen.</p>
      </div>
<div class="aside"><p>Die woord <b>galvanisering</b> is
afgelei van Luigi Galvani se
naam. Hy was ’n Italiaanse
dokter en wetenskaplike wat in
die agtiende eeu eksperimente
met elektriese strome gedoen
het.
</p>
</div>
    <p class="x--Body--above">Daar is twee maniere om metaal te galvaniseer. Die een proses noem ons
"dompelgalvanisering". Die ander proses staan bekend as "elektrogalvanisering".</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3">Dompelgalvanisering behels dat die ysterhoudende
    metaal in ’n bad vol gesmelte sink (met ’n temperatuur van
    460&#176;. gedompel word. Water kook teen 100&#176;,
    jy kan net dink hoe warm die sink is!</p>

    <div class="aside">
      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent"><b>Gesmelte –</b> ’n metaal of rots
      wat in vloeistof vorm is as gevolg van die hitte.</p>
    </div>
	
	<p>Dit beteken natuurlik dat mens die regte toerusting en veiligheidsmaatre&#235;ls in
plek moet h&#234; om dompel-galvanisering te doen.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Dompelgalvanisering het twee groot voordele: dis relatief goedkoop en baie
duursaam, omdat dit ’n relatief dik sinklaag vorm. Mens kan voorwerpe wat met
hierdie metode gegalvaniseer is, buite gebruik, selfs op die langtermyn (soos 20 tot
50 jaar). Maar daar is ook nadele. Eerstens, is die metaal se voorbereidingsproses
nogal kompleks (sien figuur 7). Dompelgalvanisering laat metaal ook dof voorkom
en die sinklaag is nie orals ewe dik nie.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Elektrogalvanisering behels dat die ysterhoudende metaal deur middel
van elektroplatering met ’n sinklaag bedek word. Julle gaan meer leer
oor elektroplatering in die volgende deel van hierdie hoofstuk. Nou
hoef julle net te weet dat elektrogalvanisering se sinklaag dunner is as
die van dompelgalvanisering dis nie so duursaam nie, maar die dikte is
egalig. Die sinklaag blink ook; en mens kan selfs klein voorwerpe maklik
elektrogalvaniseer. Dit beteken dat metaal wat op hierdie manier gegalvaniseer
is, oor die algemeen binnenshuis gebruik word. Indien mens dit buitekant wil
gebruik, sal jy die metaal ook moet verf.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-Text"><span class="Strong char-style-override-7">Galvanising is a process that
    prevents corrosion. When galvanising metal, the objects are
    coated with zinc. This is relatively inexpensive and does not

    have been galvanised are not completely protected from rust.

<figcaption>Figure 8</figcaption>
</figure>

    <div class="note">
      <p>Electroplating is a process whereby one metal is
coated with a thin layer of another metal by using
electricity and salty water (or an <b>electrolyte</b>).
</p>
<p>People do electroplating for a number of reasons.
One reason could be to protect the metal from
corrosion, such as galvanisation. Another reason
could be to make an inexpensive metal look better.
</p>
<p>For example, copper or silver jewellery is often gold
plated to make it look more expensive.
</p>
      </div>

      <div class="aside">
      <p>An <b>electrolyte</b> is a mixture
of salt and water that has the
ability to conduct electricity.
</p>
      </div>
      
    <p class="x--Body-indent para-style-override-8">Look at Figure
    8 and 9. In practice, electroplating works like this:</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3">The object that you want coated
    gets connected to the negative side of an electric cell with a
    wire. The metal that you want to coat the object with gets
    connected to the positive side of the cell with a wire. Put the
    object and the metal, with the wires attached, into a container
    with the water and salt mixture.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3">What happens next is that
    electricity and metal molecules travel from the positive side
    to the negative side. This means that after a while, a thin
    layer of metal starts to form on the object. The longer you let
    this process continue, the thicker the metal layer will be.</p>

    <div class="aside">
      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent">Table salt is one example of
      a salt. Not all salts are edible, but all salts contain a
      metal as one of their elements. For example, table salt
      consists of sodium, which is a metal, and chlorine. You can't
      use table salt for electroplating.</p>

      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent">Copper sulphate is also a
      salt. It contains copper, which is a metal, and sulphur.
      However, copper sulphate is VERY POISONOUS. You can use it
      for electroplating, but definitely not for food.</p>

    <h2>8.1 Storing grain</h2>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">Food begins to spoil the moment it is
    harvested. Food preservation has been part of all cultures
    throughout history. Food preservation enabled ancient humans to
    live in one place and form a community, unlike the Bushmen who
    had to move from one place to another. The discovery of
    food-preservation methods meant that ancient humans no longer
    had to consume hunted animals or harvested food immediately.
    They could preserve some of their food to eat at a later
    time.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">It is interesting that different
    cultures preserved their local food sources using the same
    basic methods of food preservation, for example heating,
    freezing, pickling, canning, salting, fermenting, drying and
    refrigerating.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent para-style-override-15">Food
    preservation is one of the oldest technologies. People ate what
    they grew on the land and what they hunted. They had to take
    good care of their food to prevent it from going off and making
    them ill. They also had to find ways of preserving food so that
    they would be able to eat even when there were no crops to
    harvest or when they could not hunt.</p>

    <div class="note">
      <p>Food preservation is about the treatment, handling
and storage of food to ensure that it does not lose
its nutritional value or quality. An important part
of food preservation is to create conditions that
prevent dangerous bacteria from growing.
</p></div>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3">Grain is a <b>staple food</b> for most of the
    world. Different grains are eaten in different parts of the
    world, for example in China and Japan, rice is the staple grain
    that is eaten.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3">In South Africa, wheat and maize
    are the main grains that are grown and eaten. Maize is also
    used to make a fermented drink, a type of beer that some people
    drink on special occasions.</p>

    <div class="aside">
      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent">A <b>staple food</b> is a food that is
      eaten most often by a group of people and forms the main part
      of the diet.</p>
    </div>

    <h4 class="x--Head-C">Structures for storing grain</h4>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">People have always had some method of
    storing their grain produce. Improvements in storage methods
    have also been observed over time and people used the right
    methods for their situation or need, for example storing grain
    in sacks. Grains produced by farmers who farm as a business and
    on a large scale are stored in "silos". These are huge cement
    or metal structures that hold the grain from many farms in one
    place until it can be used or exported. The silos keep the
    grain cool and free from moisture, insects and rodents.</p>

    <h4 class="x--Head-C">The process of storing grain</h4>

    <p class="x--Body-text-1-3 para-style-override-17">Firstly,
    grains need to be harvested. Small-scale or subsistence farmers
    do this by hand. Figure 6 shows harvesting on a much bigger,
    industrial scale with a combine harvester and a tractor.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3 para-style-override-18">Secondly,
    the seed, which is the edible part of the grain, needs to be
    loosened from the plant's casing that protects the seeds. The
    casing is inedible and it is called "chaff". This process is
    called threshing. Figure 7 shows the seeds still in their
    casing.</p>

    <figure>
<img class="frame-45" src="Tech_English_LG_Grade9_term4_1-web-resources/image/Tech2_gr9_ch8_fig6_opt.jpeg" alt="Tech2_gr9_ch8_fig6.tif"/>

<figcaption>Figure 6: Harvesting on an industrial scale with a combine harvester and a tractor</figcaption>
</figure>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3">The third step is called
    "winnowing". Winnowing is the process whereby the loosened seed
    is separated from the chaff. Figure 8 shows the separated,
    edible seeds, and the inedible chaff in the bucket.</p>

    <figure>
<img class="frame-46" src="Tech_English_LG_Grade9_term4_1-web-resources/image/Tech2_gr9_ch8_fig7_opt.jpeg" alt="Tech2_gr9_ch8_fig7.tif"/>

<figcaption>Figure 7: Wheat before harvesting, threshing and winnowing </figcaption>
</figure>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3">There are various traditional
    winnowing techniques. Nowadays, people use combine harvesters
    to harvest, thresh and winnow.</p>

<figcaption>Figure 8: Grain separated from the chaff</figcaption>
</figure>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3 para-style-override-17">Fourthly,
    the grain is dried to prevent fungus and bacteria from growing
    on the seeds. The ideal moisture content for wheat is about
    14%.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3 para-style-override-17">Nowadays,
    people use grain-drying machines, but in the old days, people
    dried grain with the help of the sun. Figure 9 shows a modern
    grain-drying machine.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3 para-style-override-17">Finally,
    the dried grain is stored. The humidity and temperature of the
    air are the two most important factors here.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Warm, moist air will encourage
    bacteria and mould to live on and destroy the grain, even if
    the grain has been dried beforehand. Cool, dry air will help to
    keep the grain intact for longer.</p>

    <figure>

<figcaption>Figure 10: Schematic cross section of the air movement in a grain silo</figcaption>
</figure>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3">There are all kinds of insects
    that damage grains, such as weevils and mites. Mites are very
    small insects that eat grains. Weevils are small insects that
    lay their eggs inside the grain. When the <b>larvae</b> hatch, they eat the
    seeds.</p>

    <div class="aside">
      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent"><b>Larvae:</b> the stage of an
      insect's life after it's hatched from the egg, but before it
      has changed into a mature insect.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Rodents, such as rats and mice, can
    also cause great damage to grains. They eat large amounts of
    grain if they're not controlled. Besides that, they carry
    deadly diseases that can contaminate the grain and spread to
    humans if consumed.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Now you can imagine that storing very
    large amounts of grain, for instance in a big, modern silo, is
    a complicated job, because air flow and temperature, insects
    and rodents, bacteria and fungi need to be controlled. But
    luckily, storing small amounts of grain is relatively easy. You
    need to put the grain into a clean, dry, airtight container and
    keep it in a cool place that is dry, with no direct sunlight or
    rodents.</p>

    <h2>8.2 Pickling</h2>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">Most food products deteriorate as a
    result of the presence of micro-organisms, such as bacteria,
    yeast or mould. Remember that not all bacteria is harmful. We
    need good bacteria to perform certain functions in our bodies
    and to make certain food products, such as yoghurt and
    cheese.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent para-style-override-15">In the past,
    people had to store fresh food so that it was safe to eat long
    after it was harvested. There were no fridges or freezers to
    stop food from going off. Fruit and vegetables were dried,
    salted, pickled or made into jam so that they could be eaten
    long after they were picked. Dried, pickled, salted foods and
    jams meant that people had a bigger variety of food and
    nutrients in their diet for a longer time.</p>

    <div class="note">
      <p>Pickling possibly originated when food was placed
in wine or beer to preserve it. Both wine and beer
have a low pH level. People then found many uses
for the <b>brine</b> that was left over from the pickling
process.
</p></div>

    <div class="aside">
      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent"><b>Brine</b> is a watery mix of
      vinegar and salt. Tomato sauce was an oriental fish
      brine.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3">South Africa has a few favourite
    pickles. Achaar is a traditional pickle that was brought to our
    country by the Malay people more than a century ago. It can be
    eaten as a side dish or with curry, and is widely enjoyed,
    especially in the Western Cape. Achaar is made from vegetables
    such as cauliflower, carrots, cabbage and beans, that have been
    finely cut and are mixed together with mustard, turmeric,
    coriander, vinegar and sugar.</p>

    <div class="aside">
      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent">What we know today as tomato
      sauce was originally an oriental pickle sauce for fish. It
      spread to Europe by the spice route, and eventually to
      America where someone added sugar to it. Spices were added to
      these pickling sauces to make tasty recipes.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3">Chutney is another favourite
    South African pickled product, normally made with fruit.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3">For pickling, we can use salt and
    water or salt, water and an acid, usually vinegar.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Vegetables and fish are the two most
    common food types that are pickled. Pickling preserves the food
    because the brine creates an environment where oxygen is not
    present. Thus the micro-organisms contained in and around the
    food cannot grow and multiply and, in turn, cause the food to
    go bad.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3 para-style-override-21">The food
    to be pickled is placed in a clean glass jar. A hot brine mix
    is poured over the food and covers it completely. The brine is
    poured until the jar is full. A clean, tight-fitting lid seals
    the jar. Pickles last for many months, depending on the type of
    food.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3 para-style-override-21">Pickles
    have become very popular. There are many pickling recipes
    available, and people often experiment with different
    combinations of vegetables, herbs and spices.</p>

    <h2>8.3 Drying and salting</h2>

    <p class="x--Body-text-1-3">South African <b>biltong</b> is a rich inheritance
    from innovative Dutch settlers from the seventeenth century.
    They brought recipes for dried meat from Europe. They used the
    sun to dry meat during their trek across southern Africa.</p>

    <div class="aside">
      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent">The word <b>biltong</b> is from the Dutch
      "bil" (rump) and "tong" (strip or tongue).</p>
    </div>
    
    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3 para-style-override-26">The basic
    meat spices were readily available in the Cape Colony. The
    spices for making biltong include a dramatic blend of vinegar,
    salt, sugar, coriander and other available spices.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3 para-style-override-26">Drying is
    one of the oldest methods of food preservation. Drying
    preserves food by removing enough moisture from the food to
    prevent decay and spoilage.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">The water content of properly dried
    food varies from 5% to 25%, depending on the type of food.</p>

    <h2>9.1 What are plastics, and what properties do they
    have?</h2>

    <p class="x--Body-text-1-3">Up to about 100 years ago, most
    clothes as well as many tools and appliances were made of plant
    or animal materials, such as cotton, wool, wood, animal skin,
    and bird feathers. But then chemistry scientists invented ways
    to make synthetic materials with similar properties to natural
    materials, and sometimes with useful properties that no natural
    materials have. Most of these synthetic materials are made from
    mineral oil, and most of them are called plastics. Synthetic
    materials are usually cheaper and lighter than natural
    materials with the same properties, and factories can mould the
    synthetic materials into unique shapes.</p>

    <div class="aside">
      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent">When you look at a piece of
      cloth closely you will see that it is woven from many thin
      threads, like very thin pieces of rope. If you use a
      microscope to look even closer, you will see that each thread
      is made of different long, thin pieces that hook or twist
      into one another. These long and very thin pieces are called
      <b>fibres</b>. In the
      close-up photo below you can see the plant fibres from which
      a specific fabric is made.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3">Rulers were once made from wood,
    but are now made from plastic. Buckets were first made from
    wood, then from galvanised steel, but now they are made from
    plastic as well. Milk came in heavy glass bottles or steel
    cans, but now comes in plastic bottles. Ropes were twisted from
    sisal plant <b>fibres</b>, but most
    ropes are now made from plastic fibres. Cars were made mostly
    from steel, wood and leather, but now many parts are made from
    plastics.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3">All around you, there are objects
    made of different types of plastic. Look at your shoe soles,
    your pen and ruler. In winter you may wear a fleecy jacket that
    feels like wool. That woolly substance is actually made of
    plastic fibres. Many clothes and most carpets are made from
    plastic fibres.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3">There are also disadvantages to
    synthetic materials. You learnt in Grade 8, Term 3, Chapter 8
    that most plastics do no bio-degrade as natural materials do.
    This means plastic waste lasts a very long time.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3"><b>Plastics</b> are examples of
    polymers. A polymer is a material that is made from
    <b>molecules</b> that have
    carbon atoms, hydrogen atoms and other atoms joined in long
    chains. Cotton, wool, leather, hair, starch, wood and rubber
    are examples of natural polymers. The molecule chains join
    together in different ways, so that there are many different
    kinds of polymers with different properties.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3">Plastics are man-made (synthetic)
    polymers. They are most often made from mineral oil, because
    the molecules in this oil are chains of carbon atoms, but
    shorter chains than in plastics.</p>

    <div class="aside">
      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent">The word <b>plastic</b> was originally used to
      describe a property that materials such as rubber have,
      namely that they can be given a new shape. Most synthetic
      polymers have this property, and therefore they were given
      the name "plastics".</p>

      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent"><b>Molecules</b> are made of atoms
      that join together. You know from Natural Sciences that
      molecules are much too small to see, even with a
      microscope.</p>
    </div>

    <h4 class="x--Head-C para-style-override-5">Different properties of plastics</h4>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">Depending on the type of plastic and
    the form in which it is made, it may have a few of the
    following properties:</p>

    <ul><li class="x--Body-text-bullet">
      <b>Transparent</b> means you can see
      clearly through the plastic.</li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet">
      <b>Translucent</b> means light can
      shine through the plastic even though you can't see through
      it.</li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet">
      <b>Tough</b> means the plastic will
      not break or shatter if you hit it or drop it.</li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet">
      <b>Elastic</b> means you can stretch
      the plastic far and it will still return to its original
      shape.</li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet">
      <b>Flexible</b> means the plastic can
      bend without breaking.</li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet">
      <b>Rigid</b> means the plastic will
      resist bending and stretching, but if you apply a big enough
      force to bend or stretch it, it will break or even
      shatter.</li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet">
      <b>Heat-resistant</b> means the
      plastic will not melt easily.</li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet">
      <b>Fire-resistant</b> means the
      plastic will not burn easily.</li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet">
      <b>Waterproof</b> means water will
      not pass through the plastic.</li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet">
      <b>Foamed</b> means the plastic has
      been processed to fill it with small air bubbles.</li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet">
      <b>Electrically insulate</b>d means
      the plastic does not allow electricity to conduct through
      it.</li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet">
      <b>Thermally insulated</b> means the
      plastic does not allow heat to be conducted through it
      easily.</li>
    </ul><p class="x--Body-indent para-style-override-3">In many of
    these cases, you cannot simply say the plastic has a specific
    property or does not have a specific property. For example, you
    cannot simply say a type of plastic is flexible. You need to
    say how flexible it is, for example very flexible or only
    slightly flexible.</p>

    
<h3 class="x--Head-investigation">Investigate properties of plastic objects</h3>

    <p class="x--Body-Text para-style-override-6"><b>Work in teams of three or four.</b></p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">For this activity, your teacher asked
    you to bring different plastic objects to school.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent para-style-override-24">Each team
    should take two of the objects and describe their properties.
    Write the name of the object and then write its properties next

    recycling, and identification codes</h2>

    <h4 class="x--Head-C para-style-override-5">Thermoplastic and thermosetting plastics</h4>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">Some plastics are soft or similar to
    liquid, until you heat them in a specific way, or mix another
    chemical with them. Then they "set" or become hard and rigid.
    After they set, you cannot make them soft again by heating
    them. So you cannot shape them into new products. They will
    burn, but not turn soft again. Plastic such as this is called
    thermosetting&#160;plastic.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3">Examples are epoxy-resin glue,
    shoe soles, car tyres, electrical plugs, pot handles,
    electronic circuit boards, and kitchen worktops. Thermosetting
    plastics cannot be recycled by simply reheating them. They can,
    however, be turned back into oil through a high-temperature
    chemical process called "pyrolysis".</p>

    <div class="aside">
      <p class="x--Body-box-heading"><b>Safety warning:</b></p>

      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent">Wear protective
      heat-resistant gloves, protective glasses and fire-resistant
      clothing if you try to melt plastic, since molten plastic can
      splatter and cause serious burn injuries.</p>

      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent">Never try to melt plastic by
      using a flame, since the plastic can start to burn, and it
      can release poisonous gases.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3">Other plastics melt when they are
    heated, and can then be shaped into new products. These are
    called <b>thermoplastic plastic</b>. Cool drink bottles and detergent bottles are
    thermoplastic. If you pour boiling water into it you can change
    the shapes.</p>

    <h4 class="x--Head-C para-style-override-5">Why we have to recycle plastic</h4>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">Waste plastic in the environment is a
    big problem. Most types of plastic will not bio-degrade, but
    will last for hundreds of years.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Landfills are usually near cities so
    that garbage trucks don't have to travel too far to dump the
    waste. But that means people can never build houses on that
    land or grow crops on it.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3 para-style-override-32">Any
    materials that go into a landfill will never be used again.
    Instead, people will need to extract more raw materials such as
    oil, coal, steel, wood or glass from the earth. Then they will
    burn more coal to generate electricity in order to process the
    raw materials.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3 para-style-override-32">Not all
    plastics go into landfills, though. A lot of plastic just
    remains where someone has tossed it, or is dumped into rivers
    and then goes into the ocean.</p>

<figcaption>Figure 4: Plastic waste on a sea shore. This photo was taken in Hawaii, which is why there is black volcanic rock on the seashore.</figcaption>
</figure>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">In some parts of the ocean, wind
    causes the water to flow round and round in one place. These
    areas are much bigger than South Africa. They are called "ocean
    gyres". Here, millions of floating plastic bottles, bags and
    little plastic flakes about the size of this block
    &#9744; gather.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3">Turtles mistake the plastic bags
    for jelly-fish and swallow them, which kills them. Large and
    small fish swallow the small plastic flakes. Sea-birds eat
    these fish and the plastic in the fish kills the sea-birds.</p>

      <p class="x--Body-indent">So plastic being dumped in the
    environment is a big problem. But many types of plastic can be
    <b>recycled</b>.</p>
    
    <div class="aside">
      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent">To <b>recycle</b> means to process waste
      materials to make new products from it.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-Text para-style-override-31">Waste of

    agreed on a set of codes to show which type of plastic a

    plastic waste is recycled to make new products.</p>

    <h2>10.1 Moulding recycled plastic pellets into products</h2>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">There are two steps to making plastic
    bottles, injection moulding and blow moulding.</p>

    
<h3 class="x--Head-investigation">Step 1: Injection moulding to make preforms from pellets</h3>

    <p class="x--Body-text-1-3 para-style-override-35">
    <span>Injection moulding is used to make plastic "preforms" of
    bottles. Preforms are like small bottles with very thick walls
    that already have the neck and screw-thread of the final
    bottle. Figure&#160;1 shows the preform for a plastic
    bottle</span>.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3 para-style-override-35">Figure 2
    shows the injection-moulding machine at different times of the
    injection-moulding process. In this picture, the plastic is the
    coloured substance. The raw material going into the machine is
    small, almost round pieces of plastic called pellets.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">They are initially hard since they
    have not been heated yet, and are shown in blue. The plastic
    must be soft and hot for the injection process to work.</p>

<figcaption>Figure 1: A preform of a plastic bottle </figcaption>
</figure>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">The pellets are pushed forward by a
    screw that is turned by a motor. At the same time, the pellets
    are heated until they melt. The turning force of the screw
    creates pressure that pushes or injects the molten plastic into
    the mould. Once the mould has been filled, the opening of the
    mould where the molten plastic came in is closed, and the mould
    is left to cool.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">The plastic in the mould solidifies
    as it cools down. Once it has cooled down sufficiently, the two
    halves of the mould open so that the preform that was made can
    be taken out.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Answer the following question in
    connection with Figure 2.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-investigation-hanging">1. Find the mould and
    label it.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-investigation-hanging">2. Where will you put
    a heater on the machine to melt the plastic pellets? Draw an
    extra part or parts for the machine to show where the heater
    should be, and label it.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-investigation-hanging">3. Look carefully at a
    plastic bottle. You will find a very thin ridge where the two
    parts of the mould joined. If you cannot see it, feel around
    the neck of the bottle with your finger.Why is the mould line
    on both sides of the neck?</p>

</figure>

   
<h3 class="x--Head-investigation">Step 2: Blow moulding to shape preforms into bottles</h3>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">Next, the preform goes to a
    blow-moulding machine. This machine blows hot air under high
    pressure into the preform. This heats the lower part of the
    preform so that it becomes soft and can change its shape. The
    high air pressure forces the walls of the preform to expand
    into the mould, similar to blowing up a balloon.</p>

<figcaption> 3: Blow-moulding of a preform to make a plastic bottle </figcaption>
</figure>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">The same type of preform can be made
    into different shapes of bottles, since it can be blown into
    different moulds. But all the bottles will have the same
    screw-on cap.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-investigation-hanging">1. Why will all the
    different-shaped bottles fit the same cap?</p>

    <p class="x--Body-opener para-style-override-30"><b>Reduce, re-use, recycle</b></p>

    <p class="x--Body-opener">In Grade 8 Term 4, you learnt that
    the environment is damaged when more and more things are made
    and thrown away. You learnt that waste is formed in order to
    make new products, and that the products themselves become
    waste when they are thrown away. You can reduce the negative
    impact of this practice on the environment in different
    ways.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-opener">Firstly, you can buy fewer things,
    which is called reducing your consumption.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-opener--1-3- para-style-override-35">
    Secondly, you can use some things over and over, so that you
    don't have to buy new things. This is called re-using things.
    You can also re-use something for a different purpose than it
    was originally made for. For example, many people use old
    hot-water tanks (geysers) to make "braai-skottels" in which
    they can make fire and barbeque food outside.</p>

<figcaption>Figure 2: A "braai-skottel" made from an oil tank cut through the middle </figcaption>
</figure>

    <p class="x--Body-opener--1-3- para-style-override-35">But what
    if something you own gets broken or you don't have any use for
    it anymore? Then you have to throw it away. Fortunately, there
    is a clever way of throwing things away, by separating the
    different types of waste.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-opener--1-3-">For example, if you and your
    family collect all your plastic waste separately, then someone
    can take that plastic to a recycling factory where new plastic
    is made from the old plastic. At a recycling factory, the old
    plastic is washed and shredded into very small pieces.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-opener">It is then melted and "moulded" in
    the shape of "pellets". The pellets can then be used as the raw
    material to make new plastic products.</p>

    <ul><li class="x--Body-text-bullet"> two or
      more old plastic bottles that have been cleaned,</li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet"> a marker
      pen or "koki" pen,</li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet"> nails of
      different sizes to make holes in the plastic,</li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet"> a strong
      pair of scissors to cut the plastic,</li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet"> sandpaper,
      and</li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet"> sticky
      tape to join different plastic parts together.</li>
    </ul><p class="x--Body-indent">First make sure that the plastic
    bottles are clean and that all the labels and glue have been
    removed.</p>

    <p class="x--Body--above"><b>This is how to cut a plastic bottle:</b></p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">First make a small hole with a thin
    nail where you want to start cutting. Hint: It will be easier
    to make the hole if you keep the cap of the bottle on and
    tightly secured, because then the bottle will not collapse as
    you press the nail in.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Then make the hole bigger by moving a
    thick nail around in the hole to make it bigger, as shown in
    the photo below. You can also use a cutting knife to make a
    short cut where you can then put the blade of the scissors
    in.</p>

      <p class="x--Body-box-heading">Safety warnings</p>

      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent">A pair of scissors should
      not be used like a knife. If you do that, it can slip and you
      can cut yourself.</p>

      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent">Do not try to cut the thick,
      hard parts of the bottle. If you do that, the scissors can
      slip and you can cut yourself.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3 para-style-override-51">Once the
    hole is big enough to insert one blade of the pair of scissors,
    start cutting with the scissors, as shown the photo on the
    right.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3 para-style-override-51">Use
    sandpaper to make the sharp edges of the hole in the bottle
    smooth so that it can't cut you.</p>
