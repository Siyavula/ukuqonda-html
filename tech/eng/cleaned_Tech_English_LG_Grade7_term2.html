	<h2>Shells, frames and solids </h2>
    <p class="x--Body-opener">Right now, you are sitting at a desk
    on a chair. Soon, you will write things in a book with a pen or
    a pencil. The book rests on your desk. All these objects are
    called structures. If you look around the classroom, you will
    see many other structures. For example, the classroom and the
    school buildings are structures.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-opener">In this chapter, you will learn about
    natural and man-made structures. You will also learn about
    shell structures, solid structures and frame structures.</p>

    <p class="x--Body--above">Have you ever looked closely at a
    termite mound? It really is wonderful how it contains and
    protects termites and their food against the weather and
    against their enemies. There is a whole city in there!</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">The material (soil) is reworked by
    them to make it harder so that it can withstand shocks, while
    its shape allows rain to flow off it easily. It is an example
    of a natural structure and it is not man-made.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Man-made shelters have the same
    functions - to protect people and their
    belongings. Before man-made shelters such as houses and tents
    existed, people used caves or trees for protection.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">There are lots of different
    structures around us. Some are built by us and some are already
    there in nature. The termite mound is a structure, but it is
    not built by people. We call structures like that <b>natural structures</b>.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">A cup that you use to drink tea or
    coffee is also a structure. It is a <b>man-made structure</b> because it
    was made by people.</p>

    <h2>8.3 Types of structures</h2>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">There are three basic types of
    structures: <b>shell</b>
    structures, <b>frame</b>
    structures and <b>solid</b>
    structures. But some structures are a combination.</p>

    <p> <b>Shell
    structures</b></p>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">Most containers used to hold liquids or
    small solids are shell structures. Examples are coffee mugs,
    bowls for peanuts and bags for rice or sugar.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">The strength of a shell structure is on
    its outside - in the shell.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">Chicken eggs and empty ostrich eggs are
    examples of <b>natural</b> <b>shell structures</b>.
    Soccer balls or balloons are <b>man-made</b> <b>shell structures</b>.</p>

    wind blows so that the wheel of a windmill turns, water is
    pumped from a borehole in the ground. In this way, wind is used
    as a source of energy. In the same way, wind can also be used
    to generate electricity. Many years ago, before electricity was
    discovered, windmills were used to grind grain to make
    flour.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3 para-style-override-21">A
    cellphone tower is a tall frame structure with devices called
    wave receivers and transmitters at the top. When two people

    cellphone reach the other cellphone.</p>

    specifications for school desks</h3>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">Suppose you are given the
    responsibility of ordering 100 new classroom desks for the
    school. The desks will be made at a furniture factory. This is
    the first time that school desks will be made at this factory.
    The people at the factory have no experience of making school
    desks, so you have to give them very clear instructions.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">You will soon write a document for
    the factory manager, so that he can know what the school desks
    should look like, how big and strong they should be, and what
    materials they should be made of. Before you do that, examine
    your own desk in class to help you make decisions about the new
    school desks. The new desks do not have to be exactly the same
    as your desk. You can suggest desks that are different from
    yours.</p>

    hill next to your school. Once the tower is built, the people
    in your village will be able to use cellphones. For example,
    they will be able to phone the doctor, clinic or chemist when
    they get sick. Everyone is very excited and they can't wait to
    phone their family members who live far away!</i></p>

    <p class="x--Body-story"><i>Some people are worried that the tower
    will look ugly. They think that it will not look nice next to
    the school, that it won't fit in with the surroundings. They

    <h2>Improve your design (30 minutes)</h2>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">Decide which of your two designs is the
    best.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Look at your notes to remember what

    the following questions to help you see how you can improve
    your design:</p>

    <div class="note">
    <p>Will the materials bend too easily?<br>
	Will the tower fall over easily?<br>
	Will the tower be strong enough to support the platform at the top?<br>
	Will you have all the materials you need to build your model?

    <p class="x--Body-Text">Can you think of other questions that
    would help you to improve your design?</p>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">Also think back to what you have learnt

    <ul>
      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet"><how frame

    <h2>Learn to make strong joints (60 minutes)</h2>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">When a structure breaks, it is called
    structural failure. There are three main reasons why structures
    fail:</p>

    <ul>
      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet">
      <b>When the design is
      poor.</b> If you make a bucket with a hole in the bottom,
      it will not hold water. The water will run out through the
      hole. The structure cannot work as it should, and it cannot
      do the work it was designed for.</li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet"> 
      <b>When the wrong materials
      were used.</b> The materials used for a structure must be
      strong enough for the load the structure has to carry. A
      child's chair will break when an adult sits on it, because
      the materials were not made to carry such a heavy load.</li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet"> 
      <b>When the workmanship is
      poor.</b> When the handle for the pan you fry your food in
      is not firmly fixed, it will break off. Poor quality
      workmanship can lead to your hand getting burnt.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">You will now practise making strong
    joints to help you build the model cellphone tower.</p>

    <h2>Prepare to evaluate (30 minutes)</h2>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">Next week, you have to evaluate the
    designs of the other teams, and the towers they have built.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">To do that, you will develop an
    evaluation sheet. You will use the evaluation sheet to judge
    your own tower and the towers made by two other teams.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3">In week 1 of the mini-PAT, you

      if your tower is strong enough to hold the radio transmitters
      and receivers.</li>
