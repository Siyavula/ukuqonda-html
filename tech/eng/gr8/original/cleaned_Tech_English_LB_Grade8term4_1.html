    <p class="x--Body-indent">From this activity you found that a

    and the solder knob at the bottom.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">You found that you must connect metal
    parts to make a path from the knob of a cell, through the bulb,
    and back to the flat end of a cell. This path is called a
    circuit. The current will not flow if there is a gap in the
    path of the conductors.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">The cells provide the energy to make
    the electricity flow through the circuit, and the electricity
    flowing through the "filament wire" inside the light bulb makes

    electricity flow through a circuit. In Chapter 9, you will

    <p class="x--Head-C">Why short circuits are dangerous</p>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">ESKOM supplies energy at 230 volts
    which can make a heater red-hot. This is safe in a heater,
    since only the resistor in the heater gets hot, and not the
    wires from the plug. But if the insulation is broken on the
    wires, the wires may touch each other and create a short
    circuit. The current will not go through the heater, but take
    another path along the wires instead. The current will give off
    all of its energy to the wires. Then the wires can become
    red-hot and set fire to something.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">All electrical appliances must only
    be used in the way the manufacturer recommends. Never attempt
    to fix a broken electrical appliance without expert help, and
    always make sure that appliances are switched off, or even
    unplugged when not in use.</p>

    <h2>7.3 Input, output and control devices in a circuit</h2>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Bulbs, heaters and other output
    devices have resistance. That means the electricity loses
    energy as it passes through the device, and it transfers the
    energy to the device. So a bulb is a resistor, and a heater
    element is also a resistor.</p>

    <p class="x--Head-C para-style-override-5">Control devices</p>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">We want to switch circuits on and off,
    control how much energy output we get from a circuit, or
    control how much current flows in certain parts of the circuit.
    We can do this with the use of control devices. Examples of
    control devices are switches, dimmer-switches and
    resistors.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">You have seen a light-switch on the
    wall of a room. That type of switch is called a "rocker
    switch". <a id="Anchor-12"></a>A "press switch" is used for
    doorbells. It completes the circuit only while you press it in.
    A "slide switch" is used for table lamps.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3">A "dimmer switch" lets you
    control the brightness of the lights in a room. A dimmer switch
    uses a resistor that allows you to control the current by
    twisting a knob. This is called a <span class=
    "char-style-override-6">variable</span> resistor.</p>

    <div class="frame-31">
      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent">To "vary" means to change,
      so this device is called a <span class=
      "char-style-override-7">variable</span> resistor.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Some resistors are not variable, and
    they have a fixed (unchanging) resistance. When you design a
    circuit, you can choose a resistor with the right amount of
    resistance to control the current in a part of the circuit.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">In Grade 9, you will learn about more
    types of control devices.</p>

    <h2>8.1 Energy usage in rural and informal settlements</h2>

    <p class="x--Head-C">Before electricity: Clever ways of finding
    and using energy</p>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">In earlier times, before the
    introduction of electricity, communities made clever plans to
    get light and heat &#226;&#8364;&#8220; aspects of life that
    modern humans, entirely dependent on various forms of
    electricity, simply take for granted. Let's see what
    communities in our country used for fuel and lighting before
    the advent of electricity.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">African smiths discovered how to
    produce high temperatures in their village furnaces by burning
    wood. In these furnaces, they manufactured steel for weapons
    and implements. The furnaces date back over 2 000 years. Wood
    from the indigenous <span class="char-style-override-5">acacia
    robusta</span> tree, which is particularly hard and therefore
    smoulders when it is lit, was used in these Iron-age furnaces.
    The same wood was also used for cooking fires and for lighting
    purposes.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Early "ovens" that were created by
    digging large holes and lining them with dung and other
    heat-retaining substances, were also used thousands of years
    ago.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-Text"><span><img class="frame-84" src=
    "Tech_English_LB_Grade8-term4_1-web-resources/image/Tech2_gr8_ch8_fig3_opt.jpeg"

    <p class="x--caption">Figure 3: A pit fire</p>

    <p class="x--Head-C">Energy for heating, lighting and cooking
    in rural and informal settlements in the late twentieth
    century</p>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">Electricity was introduced in the
    country early in the twentieth century, but was mainly
    allocated to cities and industrial areas. As the century
    progressed, electricity reached more populated areas, but rural
    and informal settlements were still mostly not connected. As
    late as 1994, only 1% of rural households had access to
    electricity! Other methods had to be used.</p>

    <p class="x--Body--above"><span class=
    "char-style-override-6">Heating</span></p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Coal and charcoal were the fuels
    mainly used for heating in the absence of firewood. Wood was
    cheaper than coal, but it was harder to obtain because the
    areas around the settlements had been stripped by earlier
    inhabitants.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3">Another source of energy was gas,
    but this was also expensive, and needed special equipment such
    as gas bottles and factory-made <span class=
    "char-style-override-6">elements</span> to heat the houses and
    shacks.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3">Paraffin was another popular
    source of energy because it was easy to obtain and the heaters
    that burnt paraffin could be bought quite cheaply. But paraffin
    has safety concerns, which you will look at later in this
    chapter.</p>

    <div class="frame-85">
      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent">A heating <span class=
      "char-style-override-7">element</span> converts electricity
      to heat through resistance encountered in the material the
      element is made of. When gas is used, the burning gas heats
      the element, which retains and radiates heat.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="x--Body--above"><span class=
    "char-style-override-6">Lighting</span></p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Lighting is a necessity in daily
    life. Imagine trying to do your homework in the dark! By 1994,
    candles were still the main source of lighting in rural areas.
    Eighty-two per cent of households relied on candles to provide
    lighting after dark.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Lights using paraffin as a fuel
    source made up most of the balance &#226;&#8364;&#8220; nearly
    17% of the households. People who used gas for cooking could
    also use the gas for lighting, and a few households relied on
    their wood and coal fires to provide light. Gas, wood and coal
    were not very efficient.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">A very small number of people could
    use electricity: almost less than 1% of the population of
    informal settlements.</p>

    <p class="x--Body--above"><span class=
    "char-style-override-6">Cooking</span></p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Paraffin was the fuel mostly used for
    cooking in informal settlements: over 90% of the people used
    paraffin cookers. Wood-burning and coal-burning stoves were
    used by almost all of the other households, with gas only
    occasionally being used for cooking.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Even though some areas were supplied
    with electricity, less than half of these people used it to
    cook. Stoves and electrical appliances were too expensive for
    most people living in informal settlements.</p>

    "char-style-override-6">Fire risks due to open fires as a
    source of energy</span></p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Open flames are always dangerous.
    Informal settlement housing is normally built from materials
    that burn easily, and the shacks and houses are often built
    very close together. People without electricity who are forced
    to use fire for heating, lighting and cooking have to be
    extremely careful. Carelessness can cause major fires. When a
    major fire occurs, emergency services have difficulty putting
    it out since there are no access roads for their fire engines
    or water points for their hoses. But due to the lack of basic
    services, such as electricity, people opt for the use of
    alternative, often dangerous, energy sources out of
    necessity.</p>

    for all South Africans</p>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">The South African government announced
    its policy to provide free basic services to the poor in 2000,
    the main areas of focus being free basic water, sanitation and
    power supply.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Electricity is generally cheaper than
    traditional forms of energy such as coal, paraffin, candles and
    wood. Even if the direct cost of electricity is not cheaper
    than the direct cost of wood, the indirect savings or
    advantages need to be taken into account. For example, members
    of a rural family could spend hours gathering and chopping
    firewood, hours that could be spent doing something else if
    they had electricity.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3 para-style-override-20">For the
    government to achieve their aim, about 210 000 households a
    year are being connected to the <span class=

    policy is effective.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">The government is also encouraging
    poorer people to get connected to the electricity system by
    offering an amount of free electricity. This is currently 50

    <h2>8.2 Unsafe and illegal electricity connections</h2>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">ESKOM and other companies generate
    (make) electricity and supply it to users through long wires
    called power lines. The users include shops, factories, mines
    or people who live in flats, shacks or houses. The users
    connect to the big power lines through thinner cables that go
    through metering boxes. The metering boxes measure the amount
    of energy used.</p>

    <p class="T-6point"><span><img class="frame-100" src=

    <p class="x--caption">Figure 7: Illegal electricity connections
    in an informal settlement. Notice that there is no control box
    at the top of the pole for measuring electricity usage or for
    cutting off the electricity in case of a short circuit.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">The electricity company needs money
    to buy coal, new generators, and to pay the people that
    maintain the generators. This is why we have to pay for
    electricity.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Electricity is not a cheap energy
    resource, which is why some people make illegal connections.
    Look at Figure 7. You can see the wires people have connected
    to an electricity pylon. These are illegal connections; the
    word "illegal" means "against the law".</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">The law says that only a qualified
    electrician can connect a building to the main electricity
    supply from the municipality, which is called "the mains". The
    mains supply electricity with an energy level of about 220
    volts. This much energy is enough to kill you. This means
    poorly connected wires can really hurt someone and cause a
    short circuit that could start a fire. You learnt about short
    circuits in Chapter 5.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Electricians have been trained to
    make proper and safe connections, and know how to connect the
    mains to the metering box. However, there are people who think
    they know how to work with electricity, and they connect wires
    to the mains on their own. Since this is illegal they don't
    connect a metering box. They will often use bare wire, without
    any insulation, that hangs in trees or lies on the ground. They
    leave wires where they can easily come into contact with
    corrugated zinc-iron walls and roofs, or gates and fences, or
    be cut by metal window-frames. They forget or don't know that
    all these metal objects can become conductors that will carry
    220 volts of electricity if they come into contact with the
    illegal live wires from the mains. These connections can easily
    cause short circuits that often cause fires in shacks and
    houses.</p>

    <h2>8.3 Sharing electricity fairly</h2>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">In section 8.1, you learnt how South
    Africa's government is improving the electricity supply so that
    more people can have access to electricity in their homes.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Electricity has to be generated by
    ESKOM, and they not only have to supply individual households,
    but also tend to the whole country's electricity needs. As you
    know, some systems are targeted by thieves, such as street
    lights and traffic lights. These are municipal systems. Who
    else requires electricity?</p>

    &#226;&#8364;&#8220; marks on the cell or battery you have.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">The voltage of a cell is also shown
    on it. Find the number on the cell or battery you have. It will
    be 1,5 V or 9 V. The voltage is the amount of energy that the
    cell can give to the electricity.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">In Natural Sciences this year, you
    will learn about chemical reactions. An "electrochemical cell"
    uses chemical reactions between substances inside the cell to
    give energy to electricity.</p>

    is a less expensive kind of cell that does not last as long as
    an alkaline cell. Both types of cells have a "positive

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet">Next, put the zinc washer on

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet">The cloth must not hang over
      the zinc washer, and the salt water must not run down the

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Before you connect the bulb or
    beeper, the battery has energy but it is not producing a
    current, and its voltage is about 5,8 V. As soon as you connect
    the bulb or beeper and the battery makes a current flow through
    the circuit, the voltage drops to about 1,8 V. This happens
    because the current loses a bit of its energy in the battery as
    it passes through the salt water and all the connections at the
    electrodes. You call this the "internal resistance" of the
    battery.</p>

    <p class=

    needs 12 volts and a very big current to turn the starter-motor

    <p class="x--Body-indent para-style-override-13">A car battery
    is different to the cells and batteries we usually buy. When we
    have taken all the energy from the battery, we can recharge the
    battery and give it energy again. A motor car has a "generator"
    or "alternator<span class="char-style-override-6">"</span> that
    takes energy from the engine and gives it to the battery while
    you drive the car. You will learn about generators in the next

    <h2>9.3 Photovoltaic cells</h2>

    <p class="x--Body-text-1-3">This photo shows a type of energy
    input device that you learnt about in Chapter 7. In this
    device, the energy it gives does not come from reactions
    between chemicals. Instead, it gives energy that comes from
    light. This device is called a photovoltaic cell. Photovoltaic
    comes from "photo" meaning "light" and "voltaic" meaning you
    can get volts from the device.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3">The black parts in this picture
    are a special substance called a semiconductor. This
    semi-conductor substance is made of thin layers, like sheets of
    plastic laid on top of each other. When light hits these
    special layers, the energy of the light is given to electric
    charges in the layers. The positive charges gather on one side
    and the negative charges on the other side.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">When charges are separated like this,
    there is potential energy between them. If you connect wires to
    the positive and negative sides, the charges will flow through
    an output device such as a bulb, beeper or motor.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">People often store the electrical
    energy generated by photovoltaic cells in a rechargeable
    electrochemical battery. The photovoltaic cells generate
    electrical energy during the day when the sun shines, and this
    energy is then stored in the rechargeable battery. When it is
    dark at night, the photovoltaic cells do not generate any
    electrical energy. But then people can use the electrical
    energy stored in the rechargeable battery to power lights and
    other devices.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-Text para-style-override-3">Where we use
    photovoltaic batteries</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3 para-style-override-29">Perhaps
    someone in the class has a calculator that has a little
    photovoltaic battery. When you hold the photovoltaic cell in
    sunlight, the calculator can switch on. It will work even if
    you move it into the shade since it has a little battery that
    stores the energy.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3 para-style-override-30">
    Photovoltaic cells can be very big. They can be big enough to
    cover the roof of a house.</p>

    <h2>10.1 How electricity is generated in coal-power
    stations</h2>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">When you switch a light on, where does
    the energy in the bulb come from? You can control the energy
    with a switch, but what is behind the switch?</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">In this chapter, you will find the
    answer to these questions, and find out where the power is
    generated. Before you investigate the country's electricity
    supply, you will look at the ways electricity can be generated,
    and how this affects your daily life.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">South Africa uses many power stations
    for its electricity supply. There are different types of power
    stations: coal, nuclear, hydroelectric, gas, wind and solar.
    Figure 1 shows where in South Africa these different types of
    power stations are located.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">There are no solar-power stations in
    South Africa yet, but plans are in progress to start building
    it.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">You will start this week by learning
    about coal-power stations for two reasons:</p>

    <ul>
      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet">Most of the electricity in
      the country, about 85%, is generated by coal-power
      stations.</li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet">Coal-power stations use the
      technologies of generators and turbines that are also used in
      most other types of power stations.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="x--Head-C para-style-override-5">Generators</p>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">There are three main systems that give
    us energy for lights, computers, cell phones and all other
    electrical appliances. You can get energy from batteries,
    photo-voltaic panels and generators.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">The main source of electricity in
    South Africa comes from large generators. These work exactly
    the same as any small generator you might come across. It is
    important to understand how a generator works as it is used in
    most types of power stations.</p>

    <p class="x--Body--above"><span class=
    "char-style-override-6">How a generator works</span></p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3 para-style-override-36">If you
    move a magnet near a coil of copper wire, you will create a
    voltage across the end of the copper wire. Look at Figure
    2.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3 para-style-override-37">If you
    connect a bulb across the ends of the wire, a current will flow
    around the circuit. To make the current bigger, you can use
    more copper wire in the coils, use a stronger magnet, or move
    the magnet faster.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">If the person in the picture leaves
    the magnet on the table, how much current will flow in the
    circuit? Your answer can be "a big current", "no current" or "a
    small current". Give a reason for your answer.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3 para-style-override-33">Now look
    at the girl on the bicycle. She is pedalling fast and has a
    generator connected to the back wheel of her bicycle. A bicycle
    generator is also called a "dynamo".</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3 para-style-override-38">The dynamo
    gives energy to the lamp only when the roller is spinning. The
    girl on the bicycle has to pedal faster than usual since she is
    transferring some of her energy to the dynamo, which not only
    makes her wheels move, but also lights the lamp.</p>

    that it has copper coils similar to the drawing in Figure 2. As
    the girl pedals, the copper coils spin inside the magnets, and
    this movement generates electricity.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Power stations have big dynamos
    called generators. They work exactly the same way as the dynamo
    in the pictures above but are much, much bigger! They also
    require a lot more energy to turn than only one person
    pedalling. In the next section, you will learn the various ways
    energy is provided to these big dynamos.</p>

    <p class="x--Head-C para-style-override-5">Thermal power
    stations</p>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">Thermal means "caused by heat". In
    thermal power stations, turbines are driven by steam. The steam
    is formed by evaporating water through a source of heat. The
    water is heated to form high-pressure steam by using a heat
    source such as burning coal or gas, nuclear reactions, or light
    from the sun. The water is turned into steam that drives a
    turbine, which makes an electrical generator turn. An
    electrical generator can also be called an "alternator". After
    the steam has been used, it is cooled down so that the water
    can be used again.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3">Most of the world's energy comes
    from burning <span class="char-style-override-6">fossil
    fuels</span> such as coal, oil or natural gas. This results in

    <p class="x--Head-C">Coal-fired power stations</p>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">The energy conversion process starts
    with the burning of coal that generates heat to convert water
    into steam at a very high temperature and pressure. The heat
    and pressure energy contained in the steam is used to drive the
    turbines, converting it into a rotational movement, in other
    words kinetic energy. You saw an example of this with the
    bicycle dynamo &#226;&#8364;&#8220; it is exactly the same
    process. There is a generator attached to the turbine
    shaft.</p>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet"><span class=
      "char-style-override-6">Reasons for using coal as an energy
      source</span></li>
    </ul>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">For centuries, coal was the only fuel
    source available in large quantities. Power stations were built
    near coal mines so that coal did not have to be transported
    over long distances.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Most of the coal-fired power stations
    in South Africa are found in Mpumalanga where huge coal
    deposits were discovered. Coal-power stations are the cheapest
    way to generate electricity. It is even cheaper in South Africa
    since the coal here is close to the surface and therefore easy
    to mine.</p>

    <ul>
      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet"><span class=
      "char-style-override-6">Impact on the environment</span></li>
    </ul>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Burning fossil fuels creates air
    pollution due to the carbon dioxide that is emitted during the
    process. The fires needed to produce steam from water emit a
    lot of carbon dioxide into the air, a lot more than a wood or
    coal fire in your home does. Coal has been used for centuries
    to generate heat.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide
    are two other gases emitted from coal-fired power stations that
    have a negative impact on the environment. Newer power stations
    use specific technologies to trap these gases so that they are
    not released into the atmosphere. In the past, when these two
    gases were released from coal-fired power stations, they caused
    "acid rain". Acid rain is rain that contains high levels of
    sulphuric or nitric acid, caused by the water mixing with
    sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Scientists and engineers are working
    on plans to capture carbon dioxide and store it underground,
    but this is expensive and has not yet been done on a large
    scale anywhere in the world.</p>

    <p class="x--Head-C para-style-override-5">Topic A: Gas-turbine
    power stations</p>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">As an alternative to coal, the water in
    a power station can be turned into high-pressure steam using
    burning gas. Gas is also a fossil fuel, and is normally found
    underground in areas where coal or oil is present.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3">Gas turbines in South Africa are
    equipped to burn a variety of fuels, ranging from oil to gas.
    Gas turbines have advantages over coal-burning power stations
    because of their design. Maintenance is done considerably
    faster, resulting in continuous availability of power.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Gas turbines are also capable of
    being started without an outside power source, which is very
    important. If the <span class="char-style-override-6">national
    grid</span> had to suffer a complete breakdown, the gas
    turbines can be started and will generate power to start the
    other power stations.</p>

    <div class="frame-140">
      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent">The <span class=
      "char-style-override-7">national grid</span> is the network

    <p class="x--Body-Text para-style-override-3">The future of gas
    turbines</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent para-style-override-2">South Africa
    has only recently started using gas for power stations so there
    is still a supply that will last for many years. Two of the new
    gas-turbine power stations, Ankerlig in Atlantis, and Gourikwa
    in Mossel Bay, both in the Western Cape, are going to double
    the size of their generators in the next few years, adding a
    lot of power to the national grid.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-Text para-style-override-3">Reasons for using
    this type of energy source</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3">As explained earlier, the ability
    to start a power station without power from the same network is
    very important for the national grid. There is still plenty of
    gas available in the world, however, in South Africa only small
    amounts can be mined. After pipes have been placed into a
    <span class="char-style-override-6">gas field</span> it will
    supply the power station without needing to be mined or
    transported.</p>

    <div class="frame-140">
      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent">A <span class=

    <p class="x--Body-Text para-style-override-3">Impact on the

    using three separate water systems. One of the biggest fears

    <p class="x--Body-indent">It is very important for the three
    systems to beseparate. The first system, the radioactive water
    in thereactor, is in a closed system. It does not come into
    contact with the other two systems and therefore does not
    contaminate the water in these systems. The second water system
    cools down the radioactive steam that has driven the turbines.
    It flows through the condensers where the third water system
    cools the steam back into water. The first water system
    circulates back to the steam generator where it is turned into
    steam again.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">The third cooling system for the
    condensers uses sea water at a rate of 80 tons per second to
    cool the steam. After it has cooled down, the steam is returned

    solution for the safe storage of radioactive waste. The best
    solution at the moment is to put it in very thick layers of
    concrete and lead, and bury it where no one is likely to dig it
    up. Many countries do not use nuclear fuel for power since they
    are concerned that even the buried waste will harm the

    <p class="x--Body-Text">Solar power means that the heat and
    light of the sun is used as a source of energy. Solar energy is
    a realistic option in South Africa since it is such a sunny
    country. South Africa experiences more sunshine than mostplaces
    in the world, and there is a lot of potential forthe widespread
    use of solar power. Solar power wouldbe a very good idea in
    low-income housing projects,but the initial cost of solar
    energy is very high as largeareas of <span class=

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Solar energy is a very good
    alternative for areas that are far away from the national grid,
    such as farms, rural clinics and water-pumping stations. In
    these cases, heat can be produced to power generators or
    photovoltaic cells can be used to produce electricity directly
    from sunlight. South Africa does not have a solar-powered plant
    yet, but ESKOM is currently constructing a solar-powered plant
    in Northern Cape. To help you understand how this will work,
    look at Figure 9 below that shows how mirrors and sunlight can
    be used to heat up a can of water.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">The solar-power station shown in
    Figure 10 has thousands of large mirrors, known as
    "heliostats", that move to follow the sun and reflect the heat
    to a point on a tower. Salt water is pumped up the central
    tower, where it is heated to approximately 600 &#194;&#176;C.
    This water is then used to generate steam. The steam is used in
    the same way as it is in a coal-power station to generate
    electricity.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">We could take the pressure off South
    Africa's largely coal-based energy supply by using solar power.

    <p class="x--Head-C para-style-override-5">Topic D:
    Hydroelectric-power generation</p>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">The flow of water can be used instead
    of steam to drive turbines. In hydroelectric- power stations,
    the potential energy of water stored in a dam is converted into
    electrical energy. There are two different types of
    hydroelectric-power stations.</p>

    <ul>
      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet">A simple hydroelectric-power
      station uses the downwards flow of water to generate
      electricity.</li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet">A hydroelectric-pumped
      storage scheme can also pump water back into the dam during
      times when there is electricity from other power stations
      that is not being used. Such a scheme plays the role of a
      rechargeable battery, is it stores electricity when it is not
      being used. It can also be used in the same way as a simple
      hydroelectric-power station to generate electricity, by
      letting water flow downwards out of the dam.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Hydroelectricity is renewable and
    does not pollute the environment. Large-scale hydroelectric
    schemes are, however, expensive and require the construction of
    large dams that have an impact on the environment and
    communities. Imagine you lived along a river, and you were
    ordered to move because a hydroelectric dam was to be built
    there. How would you feel about it?</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Hydroelectric-power stations are able
    to come on line within three minutes. They are therefore
    convenient to use during times of the day when there is a very
    high demand for electricity, when this demand is more than the
    other power stations can provide.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Unfortunately, due to South Africa's
    limited water resources, only a small amount of electricity can
    be generated by hydroelectric-power stations.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Dams and waterways need to be
    constructed for a hydroelectric-power station. It may be cheap
    to produce the electricity once the dam is completed, but the
    costs of building a dam are enormous, and the impact on the
    countryside can be severe.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">An environmental impact plan must be
    in place, and communities that could be affected have to be
    taken into consideration. Some people may even have to move

    thousands of years, people have used windmills and energy
    derived from the wind to pump water and to grind mealies. After
    a breakthrough by scientists, wind can now also be used to
    generate electricity. Like the sun and water flowing down a
    river, this is a renewable energy source and does not
    negatively impact the environment or pollute it. Across the
    world, wind farms are being built. These are areas where wind
    is used to turn huge windmills that generate electricity.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3 para-style-override-30">Wind speed
    and direction change from day to day, depending on the weather
    and the season. When something changes in an unpredictable way,
    it is called "erratic". The patterns of wind direction and wind
    speed are studied and used for electricity generation in areas
    that have consistent winds. This does not mean that there has
    to be strong winds or gales for the system to work. What is
    needed is a steady wind that won't damage the machinery.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">In South Africa, research on the
    potential of wind energy as an electricity- generating option
    was carried out in various places. Different ways of generating
    electricity through wind were studied. An important factor is
    cost. It doesn't make sense to put systems in place that will
    make electricity too expensive to buy.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">After investigating all the options,
    ESKOM started the Klipheuwel Windfarm Research Facility on the
    West Coast near Cape Town in 2002.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">The generators need wind speeds of
    between 47 km and 57 km per hour for full power operation, but
    they can start generating electricity in winds as low as 11 km
    per hour. If a gale force wind blows, the turbines shut off
    automatically at winds over 90 km per hour to prevent damage to
    the generators.</p>

    <h2>10.3 Transmission of electricity across the country</h2>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">The electricity that power stations
    generate is distributed across the whole country.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3">The map on the next page shows
    the main <span class=
    "char-style-override-6">transmission</span> lines that are used
    to <span class="char-style-override-6">distribute</span>
    electricity from the power stations to different parts of the
    country.</p>

    <div class="frame-11">
      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent"><span class=
      "char-style-override-7">Transmission</span> means the action
      or process of sending something.</p>

      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent"><span class=
      "char-style-override-7">Distribution</span> refers to the
      action of sharing something among a number of recipients.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3">The combination of the
    transmission and the distribution cables form a network called
    the national grid. Electricity is fed into the national grid,
    and it has to be distributed across the country to cities,
    towns and rural areas.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">The South African government
    announced its policy to provide free basic services to the poor
    in 2000. The government has focused mainly on electricity
    supply, which has led to a higher demand on our national
    grid.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Electricity supply must be consistent
    and reliable, since electric equipment can be damaged if there
    are changes in the voltage and current.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">It is very difficult to store large
    quantities of electrical energy. The energy provider must
    always match the demand of the consumers. These consumers range
    from households to huge factories, transport systems and the
    use of heavy machinery.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Specific equipment has to be
    installed to ensure that the correct voltages reach the users.
    In this section, you are going to learn about this type of
    equipment.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">As the demand increases, more power
    stations must be brought on line. This means that the power
    they generate needs to be added to the national grid.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3">It is interesting to note that
    the electricity demand not only varies from day to day, but
    from minute to minute. The <span class=
    "char-style-override-6">peak demand</span> periods are early in
    the morning and in the evening.</p>

    <div class="frame-157">
      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent"><span class=
      "char-style-override-7">Peak demand</span> means the highest
      demand during a day.</p>

    <p class="x--caption para-style-override-2">Figure 13: Map of
    electricity transmission in South Africa. Notice that the grid
    does not reach all rural areas. Electricity is generated
    locally in these places.</p>

    <p class="x--Head-C">Step-down and step-up transformers</p>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">Electricity is transferred from power
    stations to consumers over long distances through the wires and
    cables of the national grid. When a current flows through a
    wire, a bit of energy is lost in the form of heat. The higher
    the current, the more energy is lost. To reduce these losses,
    the national grid transmits electricity at a low current, but
    this requires a high voltage. Remember Ohm's law!</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Step-up transformers are used at
    power stations to produce the very high voltages needed to
    transmit electricity through the national grid's power lines.
    When the electric energy reaches the consumer area, it is
    transformed, which means changed, to a lower and safer voltage.
    Step-down transformers are used locally in sub-stations to
    reduce the voltage to safe levels.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent para-style-override-5">If you don't
    quite understand this, think of water flowing through apipe.
    The wider the pipe, the more water can be pushed through. When
    it reaches the other end, the water is funnelled into smaller
    pipes to be used in homes and factories. The same principle is
    used to distribute electricity.</p>

    <p class="x--Head-investigation para-style-override-44">Truth
    tables(30 minutes)</p>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">A computer gives many outputs depending
    on many inputs. To do this, it uses many AND-type and OR-type
    circuits inside a more complicated circuit. The AND and OR
    parts of the complicated circuits are called "logic gates".</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Computer designers and programmers
    need methods to write down all the possible "states" that the
    system can be in. A state is one possible combination of values
    for all the inputs. "Truth tables" help them to write down all
    the possible states. Computers have millions of possible
    states. But to understand the method of truth tables, you only
    need to understand the truth tables of systems with a small
    number of states.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Look back at Figure <span>8</span>,
    showing the electric paper-cutting machine. The operator has to
    press both switches to make the cutting blade move. So the
    circuit controlling the motor uses AND-type control.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Below is a truth table for this
    circuit. The inputs are the two switches. Each row of the table
    shows one possible combination of the inputs, and the output
    corresponding with it. So each row shows one possible
    state.</p>

    customers are happy with his low prices. He sells food and
    clothing cheaply because he co-operates with other shopkeepers
    in the area. They work together to negotiate with the big
    suppliers of clothing and food to get cheaper prices.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Sometimes Mr Abdullahi is alone in
    the shop. If he has to work in the office at the back of the
    shop, he closes the two front doors of the shop, but the doors
    are not locked. He will only know if someone comes in at one of
    the doors if he sees them or if they call him.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Can you make him an alarm system that
    will tell him when a door opens? Sometimes Mr Abdullahi has an
    assistant in the shop, and then he does not need an alarm, so
    he wants a switch to turn the alarm system on and off.</p>
