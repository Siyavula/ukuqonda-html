    <h3>Make bulbs light up</h3>

    <p class="x--Body-Text para-style-override-3"><b>You need all the
    components (parts) shown in Figure 2 to do this activity.</b></p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Divide into teams of four to six
    learners. Two teams can work together if there is only one cell
    per team. Discuss the following in your teams, and do the
    experiments:</p>

    <ul><li class="x--Body-text-bullet">Find out how to connect the
      parts to make the bulb light up. Find three or more ways to
      make the bulb light up.</li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet">Touch the glowing bulb using
      your fingers. What does it feel like?</li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet">Look inside the glass part of
      the bulb. Which part of the bulb gets hot?</li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet">What happens when you connect
      two cells instead of one cell?</li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet">How can you make the bulb
      flash on and off?</li>
    </ul>
    

    <p class="x--Body-indent">From this activity you found that a
    bulb will glow only if the wires touch it on the screw contact
    and the solder knob at the bottom.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">You found that you must connect metal
    parts to make a path from the knob of a cell, through the bulb,
    and back to the flat end of a cell. This path is called a
    circuit. The current will not flow if there is a gap in the
    path of the conductors.</p>

    <div class="note">
      <p>An electric circuit is a complete path of conductors.
The cells cause a current of electricity to flow
around the circuit. The current will flow only if the
circuit has no breaks in it.</p>
</div>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">The cells provide the energy to make
    the electricity flow through the circuit, and the electricity
    flowing through the "filament wire" inside the light bulb makes
    it glow.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Cells use a chemical reaction to make
    electricity flow through a circuit. In Chapter 9, you will
    learn more about the chemical reactions in a cell.</p>

    <h4>The voltage of a cell</h4>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">The cells have a number, for instance
    "1,5 V", printed on them. Find that number on your cells. The
    number represents 1,5 volts. You say that the cell has a
    <i>voltage</i> of 1,5
    volts.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3">When you connected two cells
    end-to-end you made a two-cell battery with a voltage of 3
    volts. The 3 volt <b>battery</b> can give more energy to
    the bulb and so the bulb will glow much brighter.</p>

    <div class="aside">
      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent">When two or more cells are
      connected to provide electrical current to a circuit, you
      call it a <b>battery of cells</b>, or simply a <b>battery</b>. You can also call a
      single cell a battery.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Connecting bulbs in series</h3>

    <p class="x--Body-Text para-style-override-3"><b>For this
    activity, you will need the following:</b></p>

    <ul><li class="x--Body-text-bullet">a battery made from three
      cells in series ina <b>cell holder</b> (the cells must be fairly new),</li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet">three bulbs in bulb
      holders,</li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet">connecting wires,</li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet">a <b>push switch</b>, and</li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet">a small piece of paper with
      the words"indicator bulb" on it.

        <div class="aside">
          <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent">You can make a simple
          <b>cell holder</b> by
          rolling three cells in a sheet of A4 paper. Put
          sticky-tape on the rolled-up paper to keep it in place
          and around the ends of the battery. Push the wires under
          the tape, to touch the battery terminals.</p>
        </div>&#160;
      </li>
    </ul>

    <figcaption>Figure 3</figcaption></figure>

    <div class="aside">
      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent">You can make a <b>push switch</b> from a piece of
      stiff plastic and two metal paper-fasteners. A push switch
      only makes electrical contact while you keep it pressed
      in.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Set up the circuit shown in Figure 3.
    Press the switch to make the bulb glow, and notice how brightly
    it glows. This first bulb will be your <i>indicator bulb</i>.</p>

    <div class="note">
      <p>If the indicator bulb is bright, the <i>current is big</i>.
If the indicator bulb is dim, the <i>current is small</i>.
</p>
</div>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Now connect another bulb in the
    circuit as shown in Figure 4.</p>

    <figure><span><img class="frame-13" src="Tech_English_LB_Grade8-term4_1-web-resources/image/Tech2_gr8_ch7_fig4_opt.jpeg" alt="Tech2_gr8_ch7_fig4.tif"/></span>&#160;

    <figcaption>Figure 4</figcaption></figure>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Cover the new bulb with your hand and
    look only at the indicator bulb. The indicator bulb is not as
    bright as before. What do you know about a current that has to
    run through two bulbs?</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Connect a third bulb to the circuit
    as shown in Figure 5.</p>

    <figure><span><img class="frame-14" src="Tech_English_LB_Grade8-term4_1-web-resources/image/Tech2_gr8_ch7_fig5_opt.jpeg" alt="Tech2_gr8_ch7_fig5.tif"/></span>&#160;

    <figcaption>Figure 5</figcaption></figure>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Cover both new bulbs with your hand
    and look only at the indicator bulb. How has the current
    changed?</p>

    <h4>Series connection</h4>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">When we connect bulbs with only one
    path for the current, as in Figure 5, we say that the bulbs are
    connected "in series". The current must go through each bulb in
    the row.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-investigation-hanging">1. What will happen if
    you add a fourth bulb?</p>
    <hr/><p class="x--Body-investigation-hanging">2. If we add more
    bulbs to the circuit in series, the indicator bulb will glow
    more dimly. This tells us that if we add more ........... the <i>current</i> becomes</p><hr/>

   

    <h4>Resistance</h4>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">The same battery can produce big and
    small currents. The current depends on the resistance.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">As we add more bulbs in series, the
    battery finds it harder to push current around the circuit, and
    the current becomes smaller and smaller. The reason is that the
    filament wire in each bulb has resistance. The bulbs have
    resistance and therefore we say they are
    "resistors"<b>.</b></p>

    <div class="note">
      <p>The bigger the resistance, the smaller the current.
</p>
<ul><li class="x--Body-text-bullet">Good conductors have low
        resistance, bad conductors have high resistance. Examples
        of good conductors are copper, gold, silver and aluminium.
        They have low resistance.</li>

        <li class="x--Body-text-bullet">Examples of medium or bad
        conductors are tungsten, graphite &#8722; the
        black compound in your pencil &#8722; and
        <b>nichrome</b>. They
        do conduct electricity, but not very well. The
        filament-wire in a bulb is made of tungsten.</li>

        <li class="x--Body-text-bullet">Examples of very bad
        conductors are plastic, glass and wood. They have such high
        resistance that a battery cannot make any current flow
        through them. We say they are good "insulators". The
        plastic covering on electrical wire is the insulator for
        the wire.</li>
      </ul></div>

    <div class="aside">
      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent"><b>Nichrome</b> is an alloy (mix) of
      nickel and chromium. It is often used in electrical
      appliances such as heating elements since it has a high
      resistance.</p>

    <h2>7.2 Parallel connections: Two, three or more paths for
    current</h2>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">Figure 4 shows two light bulbs
    connected in series to make them light up. Connect them again
    and try to remember how brightly they glow.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Now connect the two light bulbs in a
    different way, as shown in Figure 6 below.</p>

   <figure> <span><img class="frame-19" src="Tech_English_LB_Grade8-term4_1-web-resources/image/Tech2_gr8_ch7_fig6_opt.jpeg" alt="Tech2_gr8_ch7_fig6.tif"/></span>&#160;

    <figcaption>Figure 6</figcaption></figure>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Both bulbs light up when you press
    the switch, but now they burn brighter than they did when they
    were connected as in Figure 4.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">All the current provided by the cell
    passes through the red wire. But that current is split between
    the two blue wires.</p>

    <div class="note">
      <p>When resistors are connected in a circuit so the
current is split between the resistors, you say that
the resistors are connected in “parallel”.
</p></div>

    <h3>Connect three resistors in parallel</h3>

    <p class="x--Body-Text para-style-override-3"><b>For this
    activity, you will need:</b></p>

    <ul><li class="x--Body-text-bullet">a battery of 3 good
      cells,</li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet">4 bulbs in bulb holders,</li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet">a press switch, and</li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet">8 connecting wires.</li>
    </ul><p class="x--Body-Text">Look at the circuit in Figure 7.</p>

     <figure><span><img class="frame-21" src="Tech_English_LB_Grade8-term4_1-web-resources/image/Tech2_gr8_ch7_fig7_opt.jpeg" alt="Tech2_gr8_ch7_fig7.tif"/></span>&#160;

   <figcaption>Figure 7</figcaption></figure>
    
    <p class="x--Body-investigation-hanging">1. How many paths for
    a current can you see? With your finger, follow the paths for a
    current from the positive terminal of the battery through the
    bulbs, to the negative terminal of the battery.</p>
    <hr/><p class="x--Body-investigation-hanging">2. Will the indicator
    bulb be as bright, brighter or dimmer than in Figure 6?</p>
    <hr/><p class="x--Body-investigation-hanging">3. Test your idea.
    Make the circuit in Figure 6 and then add a bulb as in Figure
    7</p>

    <p class="x--Body-investigation-hanging">4. Was your idea
    correct?</p>
    <hr/><p class="x--Body-indent">When you connect bulbs so that the
    current has two or more paths to go through, you are connecting
    bulbs in parallel.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">If you make more parallel paths for
    current, the battery can put out more current.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">This is the same as saying that if
    you add more paths in parallel, then the resistance in the
    circuit becomes less.</p>

    <h4>Short circuits</h4>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">Look at the circuit in Figure 8.
    Someone has made a mistake and connected the orange wire from
    the terminal to the switch.</p>

     <figure><span><img class="frame-22" src="Tech_English_LB_Grade8-term4_1-web-resources/image/Tech2_gr8_ch7_fig8_opt.jpeg" alt="Tech2_gr8_ch7_fig8.tif"/></span>&#160;

   <figcaption>Figure 8</figcaption></figure>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Find the orange wire. Does it have a
    bulb connected to it?</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">This wire is a zero-resistance path
    for current. If you press the switch, the battery will put out
    as much current as it possibly can. It will do that because it
    finds a zero-resistance path.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Almost all of the current supplied by
    the battery will go through the orange wire, and only a very
    small amount of current will go through the bulb.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">The battery will put out its energy
    as fast as it possibly can. Therefore it will get hot and it
    will be "dead" or "flat" in about 10 minutes.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3">The person's mistake was to make
    a parallel path for a current with the wire. We call that path
    a <b>short circuit</b>.</p>

    <div class="aside">
      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent">A <b>short circuit</b> is a parallel
      path for current that has almost zero resistance.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="x--Body-investigation-hanging">5. Why does the bulb
    not glow if you make a short circuit path?</p>
    <hr/><p class="x--Body-investigation-hanging">6. What happens to the
    wire forming the short circuit? Why?</p>
    <hr/><p class="x--Body-investigation-hanging">7. Look at
    <span class="T-Body-Text-Char">Figure 9</span>. The bulb is
    glowing, but if you press the switch, the bulb stops glowing.
    Explain the problem, and draw a picture on the next page to
    show how you would connect the circuit in the correct way. The
    bulb should glow only when you press the switch.</p>

    <h4>Why short circuits are dangerous</h4>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">ESKOM supplies energy at 230 volts
    which can make a heater red-hot. This is safe in a heater,
    since only the resistor in the heater gets hot, and not the
    wires from the plug. But if the insulation is broken on the
    wires, the wires may touch each other and create a short
    circuit. The current will not go through the heater, but take
    another path along the wires instead. The current will give off
    all of its energy to the wires. Then the wires can become
    red-hot and set fire to something.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">All electrical appliances must only
    be used in the way the manufacturer recommends. Never attempt
    to fix a broken electrical appliance without expert help, and
    always make sure that appliances are switched off, or even
    unplugged when not in use.</p>

    <h2>7.3 Input, output and control devices in a circuit</h2>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">An electrical circuit uses an input of
    electrical energy to provide an output of some type of energy.
    Examples are described below:</p>

    <ul><li class="x--Body-text-bullet">A light bulb uses the
      <i>input</i> of
      electrical energy provided by a battery to give the
      <i>output</i> of light.
      You can say that a light bulbs <i>converts</i> electrical energy
      into light energy.</li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet">The resistance wire or
      element in a kettle gives an <i>output</i> of heat energy.</li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet">The loudspeaker of a radio
      converts an output of sound energy. This means that it gives
      out sound from the energy that is going into it.</li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet">An electric motor gives an
      <i>output</i> of movement
      or kinetic energy.</li>
    </ul><p class="x--Body-indent">We can use a systems diagram to
    describe an electrical circuit:</p>

    <figcaption>Figure 11: Output
    devices</figcaption>
</figure>
    <p class="x--Body-indent">Bulbs, heaters and other output
    devices have resistance. That means the electricity loses
    energy as it passes through the device, and it transfers the
    energy to the device. So a bulb is a resistor, and a heater
    element is also a resistor.</p>

    <div class="note">
      <p>Output devices have resistance.
</p></div>

    <h4 class="x--Head-C para-style-override-5">Control devices</h4>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">We want to switch circuits on and off,
    control how much energy output we get from a circuit, or
    control how much current flows in certain parts of the circuit.
    We can do this with the use of control devices. Examples of
    control devices are switches, dimmer-switches and
    resistors.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">You have seen a light-switch on the
    wall of a room. That type of switch is called a "rocker
    switch". <a id="Anchor-12"/>A "press switch" is used for
    doorbells. It completes the circuit only while you press it in.
    A "slide switch" is used for table lamps.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3">A "dimmer switch" lets you
    control the brightness of the lights in a room. A dimmer switch
    uses a resistor that allows you to control the current by
    twisting a knob. This is called a <b>variable</b> resistor.</p>

    <div class="aside">
      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent">To "vary" means to change,
      so this device is called a <b>variable</b> resistor.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Some resistors are not variable, and
    they have a fixed (unchanging) resistance. When you design a
    circuit, you can choose a resistor with the right amount of
    resistance to control the current in a part of the circuit.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">In Grade 9, you will learn about more
    types of control devices.</p>

    <h3>The symbols used to draw circuit diagrams</h3>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">After you have worked with real
    electric circuits, you can start drawing them with symbols
    instead of trying to draw what the circuit really looks like.
    Engineers, scientists and technicians mostly use symbols and
    diagrams.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent para-style-override-14">A list of
    symbols for different electrical components is given on the
    following two pages. In Grade 9, you will learn the symbols for
    even more components.</p>

    <h2>8.1 Energy usage in rural and informal settlements</h2>

    <h4>Before electricity: Clever ways of finding and using energy</h4>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">In earlier times, before the
    introduction of electricity, communities made clever plans to
    get light and heat &#8722; aspects of life that
    modern humans, entirely dependent on various forms of
    electricity, simply take for granted. Let's see what
    communities in our country used for fuel and lighting before
    the advent of electricity.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">African smiths discovered how to
    produce high temperatures in their village furnaces by burning
    wood. In these furnaces, they manufactured steel for weapons
    and implements. The furnaces date back over 2 000 years. Wood
    from the indigenous <span class="char-style-override-5">acacia
    robusta</span> tree, which is particularly hard and therefore
    smoulders when it is lit, was used in these Iron-age furnaces.
    The same wood was also used for cooking fires and for lighting
    purposes.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Early "ovens" that were created by
    digging large holes and lining them with dung and other
    heat-retaining substances, were also used thousands of years
    ago.</p>

    <h4>Energy for heating, lighting and cooking in rural and informal settlements in the late twentieth century</h4>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">Electricity was introduced in the
    country early in the twentieth century, but was mainly
    allocated to cities and industrial areas. As the century
    progressed, electricity reached more populated areas, but rural
    and informal settlements were still mostly not connected. As
    late as 1994, only 1% of rural households had access to
    electricity! Other methods had to be used.</p>

    <p class="x--Body--above"><b>Heating</b></p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Coal and charcoal were the fuels
    mainly used for heating in the absence of firewood. Wood was
    cheaper than coal, but it was harder to obtain because the
    areas around the settlements had been stripped by earlier
    inhabitants.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3">Another source of energy was gas,
    but this was also expensive, and needed special equipment such
    as gas bottles and factory-made <b>elements</b> to heat the houses and
    shacks.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3">Paraffin was another popular
    source of energy because it was easy to obtain and the heaters
    that burnt paraffin could be bought quite cheaply. But paraffin
    has safety concerns, which you will look at later in this
    chapter.</p>

    <div class="aside">
      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent">A heating <b>element</b> converts electricity
      to heat through resistance encountered in the material the
      element is made of. When gas is used, the burning gas heats
      the element, which retains and radiates heat.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Lighting is a necessity in daily
    life. Imagine trying to do your homework in the dark! By 1994,
    candles were still the main source of lighting in rural areas.
    Eighty-two per cent of households relied on candles to provide
    lighting after dark.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Lights using paraffin as a fuel
    source made up most of the balance &#8722; nearly
    17% of the households. People who used gas for cooking could
    also use the gas for lighting, and a few households relied on
    their wood and coal fires to provide light. Gas, wood and coal
    were not very efficient.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">A very small number of people could
    use electricity: almost less than 1% of the population of
    informal settlements.</p>

    <p class="x--Body--above"><b>Cooking</b></p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Paraffin was the fuel mostly used for
    cooking in informal settlements: over 90% of the people used
    paraffin cookers. Wood-burning and coal-burning stoves were
    used by almost all of the other households, with gas only
    occasionally being used for cooking.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Even though some areas were supplied
    with electricity, less than half of these people used it to
    cook. Stoves and electrical appliances were too expensive for
    most people living in informal settlements.</p>

    <p class="x--Body--above"><b><b>Fire risks due to open fires as a source of energy</b></b></p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Open flames are always dangerous.
    Informal settlement housing is normally built from materials
    that burn easily, and the shacks and houses are often built
    very close together. People without electricity who are forced
    to use fire for heating, lighting and cooking have to be
    extremely careful. Carelessness can cause major fires. When a
    major fire occurs, emergency services have difficulty putting
    it out since there are no access roads for their fire engines
    or water points for their hoses. But due to the lack of basic
    services, such as electricity, people opt for the use of
    alternative, often dangerous, energy sources out of
    necessity.</p>

    <div class="note">
      <p>A rural settlement is far away from any towns,
cities or big industries, such as mines. An informal
settlement consists of temporary houses for people
who moved closer to a town, city or industry,
usually to find work.
Rural settlements are often far away from power
stations, as well as from towns and cities where
there are already electricity transmission lines. It
is expensive to build electricity transmission lines
to far-away places. It also takes times to plan and
build them.
Some people in rural settlements cannot afford to
pay for electricity.
Informal settlements are usually built very quickly
and without planning, so there is no time to plan
or build electricity transmission lines before the
people move there.
Some people in informal settlements cannot afford
to pay for electricity either.

    <h4>The present: Energy
    for all South Africans</h4>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">The South African government announced
    its policy to provide free basic services to the poor in 2000,
    the main areas of focus being free basic water, sanitation and
    power supply.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Electricity is generally cheaper than
    traditional forms of energy such as coal, paraffin, candles and
    wood. Even if the direct cost of electricity is not cheaper
    than the direct cost of wood, the indirect savings or
    advantages need to be taken into account. For example, members
    of a rural family could spend hours gathering and chopping
    firewood, hours that could be spent doing something else if
    they had electricity.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3 para-style-override-20">For the
    government to achieve their aim, about 210 000 households a
    year are being connected to the <b>national grid</b> and another 10 000
    a year are supplied with <b>renewable energy.</b></p>

    <div class="aside">
      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent">The electricity network
      across South Africa is called the <b>national grid</b>. It includes
      power stations, power lines and substations.</p>

      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent"><b>Renewable energy</b> is energy
      that comes from resources that will not run out. The sun and
      wind are the most common sources of renewable energy.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="note">
      <p>Of the 12,8 million households that are electrified in
South Africa, about 52 000, mostly in rural areas, are
being supplied by basic solar power. This is when
the sun’s energy is gathered to charge batteries that
are then used to power appliances.
</p></div>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">By 2013, 85% of the country had been
    given access to electricity. In 1994, only 37% of the country
    had electrical power, so it can be said that the government's
    policy is effective.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">The government is also encouraging
    poorer people to get connected to the electricity system by
    offering an amount of free electricity. This is currently 50
    kWh per household, per month.</p>

    <p class="x--Body--above">Andile lives here. He plans to be an

    need. He already knows the following:</p>

    <ul><li class="x--Body-text-bullet">The people in this community
      pay for energy when they use vehicles such as cars, buses and
      taxis. The petrol is the energy resource these vehicles
      need.</li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet">The people also pay for
      energy when they buy food to eat. Food is the energy resource
      they need to function.</li>
    </ul><p class="x--Body-indent">Now he wants to ask them about the
    energy they use for heating their homes in winter, for cooking
    food and boiling water, and for light at night.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">He separates the <i>energy resources</i> from the
    <i>systems</i> they use.
    For example, paraffin is an energy resource that people pay
    for. But they use paraffin in different systems: paraffin
    stoves, paraffin heaters, paraffin lamps, and even fridges that
    work with paraffin.</p>

    <h2>8.2 Unsafe and illegal electricity connections</h2>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">ESKOM and other companies generate
    (make) electricity and supply it to users through long wires
    called power lines. The users include shops, factories, mines
    or people who live in flats, shacks or houses. The users
    connect to the big power lines through thinner cables that go
    through metering boxes. The metering boxes measure the amount
    of energy used.</p>

    <figcaption>Figure 7: Illegal electricity connections
    in an informal settlement. Notice that there is no control box
    at the top of the pole for measuring electricity usage or for
    cutting off the electricity in case of a short circuit.</figcaption></figure>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">The electricity company needs money
    to buy coal, new generators, and to pay the people that
    maintain the generators. This is why we have to pay for
    electricity.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Electricity is not a cheap energy
    resource, which is why some people make illegal connections.
    Look at Figure 7. You can see the wires people have connected
    to an electricity pylon. These are illegal connections; the
    word "illegal" means "against the law".</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">The law says that only a qualified
    electrician can connect a building to the main electricity
    supply from the municipality, which is called "the mains". The
    mains supply electricity with an energy level of about 220
    volts. This much energy is enough to kill you. This means
    poorly connected wires can really hurt someone and cause a
    short circuit that could start a fire. You learnt about short
    circuits in Chapter 5.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Electricians have been trained to
    make proper and safe connections, and know how to connect the
    mains to the metering box. However, there are people who think
    they know how to work with electricity, and they connect wires
    to the mains on their own. Since this is illegal they don't
    connect a metering box. They will often use bare wire, without
    any insulation, that hangs in trees or lies on the ground. They
    leave wires where they can easily come into contact with
    corrugated zinc-iron walls and roofs, or gates and fences, or
    be cut by metal window-frames. They forget or don't know that
    all these metal objects can become conductors that will carry
    220 volts of electricity if they come into contact with the
    illegal live wires from the mains. These connections can easily
    cause short circuits that often cause fires in shacks and
    houses.</p>

    <h2>8.3 Sharing electricity fairly</h2>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">In section 8.1, you learnt how South
    Africa's government is improving the electricity supply so that
    more people can have access to electricity in their homes.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Electricity has to be generated by
    ESKOM, and they not only have to supply individual households,
    but also tend to the whole country's electricity needs. As you
    know, some systems are targeted by thieves, such as street
    lights and traffic lights. These are municipal systems. Who
    else requires electricity?</p>

    <h2>9.1 Electrochemical cells and batteries</h2>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">In Chapter 7, you used cells such as
    the one in Figure 2 below.</p>

    </figure>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">The cells have a positive terminal
    and a negative terminal. The positive terminal is the knob on
    the top of the cell and the negative terminal is the flat end
    of the cell. The terminals are marked + for positive and
    &#8722; for negative. Find the + and
    &#8722; marks on the cell or battery you have.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">The voltage of a cell is also shown
    on it. Find the number on the cell or battery you have. It will
    be 1,5 V or 9 V. The voltage is the amount of energy that the
    cell can give to the electricity.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">In Natural Sciences this year, you
    will learn about chemical reactions. An "electrochemical cell"
    uses chemical reactions between substances inside the cell to
    give energy to electricity.</p>

    <h3>What is inside a cell?</h3>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">You can buy two types of
    electrochemical cells. The pictures below are called "cut-away

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3">The zinc-carbon cell in Figure 3
    is a less expensive kind of cell that does not last as long as
    an alkaline cell. Both types of cells have a "positive
    electrode" and a "negative electrode", and these electrodes are
    in a syrupy substance called an "<b>electrolyte</b> paste."</p>

    <div class="aside">
      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent">The <b>electrolyte</b> in the alkaline
      cell contains potassium hydroxide, which is an alkali. This
      is the reason for the name of the cell.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">In the zinc-carbon cell, the negative
    electrode is made of zinc metal. This zinc has been shaped into
    the casing that contains the paste of electrolyte. Outside the
    zinc casing is a thin steel casing, which prevents you from
    seeing the zinc.</p>

    <ul><li class="x--Body-text-bullet">Fold the cooking foil
      lengthwise, so that you have a long piece that is double in

      aluminium, which is a good conductor.</li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet">Squeeze the salty water out
      of the cloth.</li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet">Next, put the zinc washer on
      the foil, put the wet cloth on the washer, and put the copper
      coin on top of the wet cloth.</li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet">The cloth must not hang over
      the zinc washer, and the salt water must not run down the
      sides of the coin and washer. If this happens, it will create
      a short circuit between the copper and zinc, which you don't
      want.</li>
    </ul><p class="x--Body-indent">The zinc washer is your <i>negative electrode</i>, the copper
    coin is your <span class="char-style-override-5">positive
    electrode</span>, and the salt water is your <i>electrolyte</i>.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Now you have made a cell. The cooking
    foil is the negative terminal where you can connect the

    <p class="x--Body-indent"><span>You have two
    5-cent coins. The first one is the positive

    is there to press the foil down on the first coin
    to make good contact.</span></p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Use sticky tape to hold the cooking
    foil down on the table, and connect wires to the ends. The ends
    of the foil are your terminals.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Your teacher will measure the voltage
    of the whole battery. With six cells, the voltage of the
    battery will be about 6 volts or slightly less.</p>



    <p class="x--Body-indent"><span>Now connect a light bulb to the
    positive and negative terminals of the battery. Does the light
    bulb glow?</span></p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Connect a beeper to the positive and
    negative terminals. Remember to connect the red wire to the
    positive terminal. Can you hear it beep?</p>

    <p class="x--Body-investigation-hanging">1. <span>What are the
    two different metals used for the positive and negative
    electrodes?</span></p>
    <hr/><p class="x--Body-investigation-hanging">2. How is the voltage

    <hr/><p class="x--Body-Text para-style-override-3"><b>Batteries do not
    provide the full amount of volts</b></p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Before you connect the bulb or
    beeper, the battery has energy but it is not producing a
    current, and its voltage is about 5,8 V. As soon as you connect
    the bulb or beeper and the battery makes a current flow through
    the circuit, the voltage drops to about 1,8 V. This happens
    because the current loses a bit of its energy in the battery as
    it passes through the salt water and all the connections at the
    electrodes. You call this the "internal resistance" of the
    battery.</p>

    and start the engine. Sometimes, on cold mornings, a car won't
    start. A mechanic can test the battery, and might say "There is

    can you measure to test your idea?</p>
    <hr/><p class="x--Body-indent para-style-override-13">A car battery
    is different to the cells and batteries we usually buy. When we
    have taken all the energy from the battery, we can recharge the
    battery and give it energy again. A motor car has a "generator"
    or "alternator<b>"</b> that
    takes energy from the engine and gives it to the battery while
    you drive the car. You will learn about generators in the next
    chapter. A cell-phone battery is also a rechargeable
    battery.</p>

    
    <h3>Batteries with cells in series or in parallel</h3>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">In Chapter 7, you learnt about
    connecting bulbs in series or in parallel. You can also connect
    <i>cells</i> in series or

    and "cells in series". Look at the two figures below.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">The bulbs in Figure 10 glow brighter
    than those in Figure 9 because they share the 4,5&#160;V from
    the cells in series, so they get 2,25&#160;V each. The bulbs in
    Figure 9 share the 1,5&#160;Volts from one cell, so they get
    only 0,75 V each.</p>

    <h2>9.3 Photovoltaic cells</h2>

    <p class="x--Body-text-1-3">This photo shows a type of energy
    input device that you learnt about in Chapter 7. In this
    device, the energy it gives does not come from reactions
    between chemicals. Instead, it gives energy that comes from
    light. This device is called a photovoltaic cell. Photovoltaic
    comes from "photo" meaning "light" and "voltaic" meaning you
    can get volts from the device.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3">The black parts in this picture
    are a special substance called a semiconductor. This
    semi-conductor substance is made of thin layers, like sheets of
    plastic laid on top of each other. When light hits these
    special layers, the energy of the light is given to electric
    charges in the layers. The positive charges gather on one side
    and the negative charges on the other side.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">When charges are separated like this,
    there is potential energy between them. If you connect wires to
    the positive and negative sides, the charges will flow through
    an output device such as a bulb, beeper or motor.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">People often store the electrical
    energy generated by photovoltaic cells in a rechargeable
    electrochemical battery. The photovoltaic cells generate
    electrical energy during the day when the sun shines, and this
    energy is then stored in the rechargeable battery. When it is
    dark at night, the photovoltaic cells do not generate any
    electrical energy. But then people can use the electrical
    energy stored in the rechargeable battery to power lights and
    other devices.</p>

    photovoltaic batteries</b></p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3 para-style-override-29">Perhaps
    someone in the class has a calculator that has a little
    photovoltaic battery. When you hold the photovoltaic cell in
    sunlight, the calculator can switch on. It will work even if
    you move it into the shade since it has a little battery that
    stores the energy.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3 para-style-override-30">
    Photovoltaic cells can be very big. They can be big enough to
    cover the roof of a house.</p>

       <h2>10.1 How electricity is generated in coal-power
    stations</h2>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">When you switch a light on, where does
    the energy in the bulb come from? You can control the energy
    with a switch, but what is behind the switch?</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">In this chapter, you will find the
    answer to these questions, and find out where the power is
    generated. Before you investigate the country's electricity
    supply, you will look at the ways electricity can be generated,
    and how this affects your daily life.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">South Africa uses many power stations
    for its electricity supply. There are different types of power
    stations: coal, nuclear, hydroelectric, gas, wind and solar.
    Figure 1 shows where in South Africa these different types of
    power stations are located.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">There are no solar-power stations in
    South Africa yet, but plans are in progress to start building
    it.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">You will start this week by learning
    about coal-power stations for two reasons:</p>

    <ul><li class="x--Body-text-bullet">Most of the electricity in
      the country, about 85%, is generated by coal-power
      stations.</li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet">Coal-power stations use the
      technologies of generators and turbines that are also used in
      most other types of power stations.</li>
    </ul><h4>Generators</h4>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">There are three main systems that give
    us energy for lights, computers, cell phones and all other
    electrical appliances. You can get energy from batteries,
    photo-voltaic panels and generators.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">The main source of electricity in
    South Africa comes from large generators. These work exactly
    the same as any small generator you might come across. It is
    important to understand how a generator works as it is used in
    most types of power stations.</p>

    <p class="x--Body--above"><b>How a generator works</b></p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3 para-style-override-36">If you
    move a magnet near a coil of copper wire, you will create a
    voltage across the end of the copper wire. Look at Figure
    2.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3 para-style-override-37">If you
    connect a bulb across the ends of the wire, a current will flow
    around the circuit. To make the current bigger, you can use
    more copper wire in the coils, use a stronger magnet, or move
    the magnet faster.</p>

    <div><figure>
      <div class="frame-111"><img class="frame-136" src="Tech_English_LB_Grade8-term4_1-web-resources/image/Tech2_gr8_ch10_fig2_opt.jpeg" alt="Tech2_gr8_ch10_fig2.tif"/></div>

      <div>
        <figcaption>Figure 2: A home-made generator</figcaption>
      </div></figure>
    </div>


    <p class="x--Body-indent">If the person in the picture leaves
    the magnet on the table, how much current will flow in the
    circuit? Your answer can be "a big current", "no current" or "a
    small current". Give a reason for your answer.</p>
    <hr/><p class="x--Body-indent-1-3 para-style-override-33">Now look
    at the girl on the bicycle. She is pedalling fast and has a
    generator connected to the back wheel of her bicycle. A bicycle
    generator is also called a "dynamo".</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3 para-style-override-38">The dynamo
    gives energy to the lamp only when the roller is spinning. The
    girl on the bicycle has to pedal faster than usual since she is
    transferring some of her energy to the dynamo, which not only
    makes her wheels move, but also lights the lamp.</p>

    <div><figure>
      <div class="frame-111"><img class="frame-137" src="Tech_English_LB_Grade8-term4_1-web-resources/image/Tech2_gr8_ch10_fig3_opt.jpeg" alt="Tech2_gr8_ch10_fig3.tif"/></div>

      <div>
      <figcaption>Figure 3: The dynamo on a bicycle</figcaption>
      </div></figure>
    </div>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">If you open a dynamo, you will see
    that it has copper coils similar to the drawing in Figure 2. As
    the girl pedals, the copper coils spin inside the magnets, and
    this movement generates electricity.</p>

    <div><figure>
      <div class="frame-111"><img class="frame-138" src="Tech_English_LB_Grade8-term4_1-web-resources/image/Tech2_gr8_ch10_fig4_opt.jpeg" alt="Tech2_gr8_ch10_fig4.jpg"/></div>

    <figcaption>Figure 5: The exposed copper coils in a dynamo</figcaption></figure> 
    </div>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Power stations have big dynamos
    called generators. They work exactly the same way as the dynamo
    in the pictures above but are much, much bigger! They also
    require a lot more energy to turn than only one person
    pedalling. In the next section, you will learn the various ways
    energy is provided to these big dynamos.</p>

    <h4>Thermal power stations</h4>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">Thermal means "caused by heat". In
    thermal power stations, turbines are driven by steam. The steam
    is formed by evaporating water through a source of heat. The
    water is heated to form high-pressure steam by using a heat
    source such as burning coal or gas, nuclear reactions, or light
    from the sun. The water is turned into steam that drives a
    turbine, which makes an electrical generator turn. An
    electrical generator can also be called an "alternator". After
    the steam has been used, it is cooled down so that the water
    can be used again.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3">Most of the world's energy comes
    from burning <b>fossil fuels</b> such as coal, oil or natural gas. This results in
    high levels of air pollution, particularly from greenhouse
    gases that contribute to climate change. Fossil fuels will run
    out in the future.</p>

    <div class="aside">
      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent"><b>Fossil fuels</b> are carbon-based
      fuels that are taken from the earth, and are made of the
      remains of living things that died millions of years ago.</p>

    <figcaption>Figure 6: A
    coal-fired power station</figcaption></figure>

    <h4>Coal-fired power stations</h4>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">The energy conversion process starts
    with the burning of coal that generates heat to convert water
    into steam at a very high temperature and pressure. The heat
    and pressure energy contained in the steam is used to drive the
    turbines, converting it into a rotational movement, in other
    words kinetic energy. You saw an example of this with the
    bicycle dynamo &#8722; it is exactly the same
    process. There is a generator attached to the turbine
    shaft.</p>

    <ul><li class="x--Body-text-bullet"><b>Reasons for using coal as an energy source</b></li>
    </ul><p class="x--Body-indent">For centuries, coal was the only fuel
    source available in large quantities. Power stations were built
    near coal mines so that coal did not have to be transported
    over long distances.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Most of the coal-fired power stations
    in South Africa are found in Mpumalanga where huge coal
    deposits were discovered. Coal-power stations are the cheapest
    way to generate electricity. It is even cheaper in South Africa
    since the coal here is close to the surface and therefore easy
    to mine.</p>

    <ul><li class="x--Body-text-bullet"><b>Impact on the environment</b></li>
    </ul><p class="x--Body-indent">Burning fossil fuels creates air
    pollution due to the carbon dioxide that is emitted during the
    process. The fires needed to produce steam from water emit a
    lot of carbon dioxide into the air, a lot more than a wood or
    coal fire in your home does. Coal has been used for centuries
    to generate heat.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide
    are two other gases emitted from coal-fired power stations that
    have a negative impact on the environment. Newer power stations
    use specific technologies to trap these gases so that they are
    not released into the atmosphere. In the past, when these two
    gases were released from coal-fired power stations, they caused
    "acid rain". Acid rain is rain that contains high levels of
    sulphuric or nitric acid, caused by the water mixing with
    sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Scientists and engineers are working
    on plans to capture carbon dioxide and store it underground,
    but this is expensive and has not yet been done on a large
    scale anywhere in the world.</p>

    questions for only one other type of power station.
    <b>Work individually.</b></p>

    <h4>Topic A: Gas-turbine power stations</h4>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">As an alternative to coal, the water in
    a power station can be turned into high-pressure steam using
    burning gas. Gas is also a fossil fuel, and is normally found
    underground in areas where coal or oil is present.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3">Gas turbines in South Africa are
    equipped to burn a variety of fuels, ranging from oil to gas.
    Gas turbines have advantages over coal-burning power stations
    because of their design. Maintenance is done considerably
    faster, resulting in continuous availability of power.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Gas turbines are also capable of
    being started without an outside power source, which is very
    important. If the <b>national grid</b> had to suffer a complete breakdown, the gas
    turbines can be started and will generate power to start the
    other power stations.</p>

    <div class="aside">
      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent">The <b>national grid</b> is the network
      of transmission lines that are connected and supplied by all

    <p class="x--Body-indent para-style-override-2">South Africa
    has only recently started using gas for power stations so there
    is still a supply that will last for many years. Two of the new
    gas-turbine power stations, Ankerlig in Atlantis, and Gourikwa
    in Mossel Bay, both in the Western Cape, are going to double
    the size of their generators in the next few years, adding a
    lot of power to the national grid.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-Text para-style-override-3"><b>Reasons for using
    this type of energy source</b></p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3">As explained earlier, the ability
    to start a power station without power from the same network is
    very important for the national grid. There is still plenty of
    gas available in the world, however, in South Africa only small
    amounts can be mined. After pipes have been placed into a
    <b>gas field</b> it will
    supply the power station without needing to be mined or

    <h4>Topic B: Nuclear power stations</h4>

    <figcaption>Figure 8: A nuclear power station</figcaption></figure>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">There is a nuclear power station,
    called Koeberg, close to Cape Town.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3">Unlike gas-burning or
    coal-burning power stations, a nuclear power station operates
    using three separate water systems. One of the biggest fears
    that people have about nuclear power stations is that
    <b>radioactive</b> material
    might escape and pollute the air of nearby areas.</p>

    <div class="aside">
      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent"><b>Radioactive</b> substances give
      off energy that is dangerous to living things. It can cause
      cancer and other health risks, so it is important that people
      are shielded from radioactive material.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">It is very important for the three
    systems to beseparate. The first system, the radioactive water
    in thereactor, is in a closed system. It does not come into
    contact with the other two systems and therefore does not
    contaminate the water in these systems. The second water system
    cools down the radioactive steam that has driven the turbines.
    It flows through the condensers where the third water system
    cools the steam back into water. The first water system
    circulates back to the steam generator where it is turned into
    steam again.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">The third cooling system for the
    condensers uses sea water at a rate of 80 tons per second to
    cool the steam. After it has cooled down, the steam is returned
    to the sea.</p>

    <ul><li class="x--Body-text-bullet"><b>Reasons for using this type of energy source</b></li>
    </ul><p class="x--Body-indent">Many places don't have a supply of
    fossil fuels to power generators. Small amounts of nuclear fuel
    can generate enormous amounts of electricity.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Nuclear-power stations require very
    little maintenance. Because the water used in the first system
    is recycled, there is very little waste of precious water. The
    cooling water is unpolluted and returned to the sea.</p>

    <ul><li class="x--Body-text-bullet"><b>Impact on the environment</b></li>
    </ul><p class="x--Body-indent">Radioactive material creates
    radioactive waste, which is extremely dangerous. Although the
    amount of waste is very small, it remains active and dangerous
    for many thousands of years! There is currently no long-term
    solution for the safe storage of radioactive waste. The best
    solution at the moment is to put it in very thick layers of
    concrete and lead, and bury it where no one is likely to dig it
    up. Many countries do not use nuclear fuel for power since they
    are concerned that even the buried waste will harm the
    environment. Nuclear power has been used around the world since
    the 1950s as an alternative source of energy.</p>

    <h4>Topic C: Solar power</h4>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">Solar power means that the heat and
    light of the sun is used as a source of energy. Solar energy is
    a realistic option in South Africa since it is such a sunny
    country. South Africa experiences more sunshine than mostplaces
    in the world, and there is a lot of potential forthe widespread
    use of solar power. Solar power wouldbe a very good idea in
    low-income housing projects,but the initial cost of solar
    energy is very high as largeareas of <b>solar panels</b> are needed.</p>

    <div class="aside">
      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent"><b>Solar panels</b>, or photovoltaic
      cells, convert sunlight to electricity.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Solar energy is a very good
    alternative for areas that are far away from the national grid,
    such as farms, rural clinics and water-pumping stations. In
    these cases, heat can be produced to power generators or
    photovoltaic cells can be used to produce electricity directly
    from sunlight. South Africa does not have a solar-powered plant
    yet, but ESKOM is currently constructing a solar-powered plant
    in Northern Cape. To help you understand how this will work,
    look at Figure 9 below that shows how mirrors and sunlight can
    be used to heat up a can of water.</p>

    <figcaption>Figure 10: Mirrors in a solar-powered power
    stationcan. focus light onto heating towers.</figcaption></figure>
    </div>

    <p class="x--Body--above"><b>How does a steam-driven solar-power station work?</b></p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">The solar-power station shown in
    Figure 10 has thousands of large mirrors, known as
    "heliostats", that move to follow the sun and reflect the heat
    to a point on a tower. Salt water is pumped up the central
    tower, where it is heated to approximately 600 &#176;C.
    This water is then used to generate steam. The steam is used in
    the same way as it is in a coal-power station to generate
    electricity.</p>

    <ul><li class="x--Body-text-bullet"><b>Reasons for using this type of energy source</b></li>
    </ul><p class="x--Body-indent">Solar energy is a realistic option in
    any sunny country. Solar energy can be used in areas far away
    from the national grid and can be set up to provide power for
    smaller communities.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">We could take the pressure off South
    Africa's largely coal-based energy supply by using solar power.
    This would also give the country a larger overall energy
    capacity and help us to achieve our target of a 34% reduction
    in carbon-dioxide emissions by 2020.</p>

    <ul><li class="x--Body-text-bullet"><b>Impact on the environment</b></li>
    </ul><p class="x--Body-indent">Solar power produces no pollution.
    However, the power stations can take up a lot of space due to
    the large mirrors. They could be regarded as visual
    pollution.</p>

    <h4>Topic D: Hydroelectric-power generation</h4>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">The flow of water can be used instead
    of steam to drive turbines. In hydroelectric- power stations,
    the potential energy of water stored in a dam is converted into
    electrical energy. There are two different types of
    hydroelectric-power stations.</p>

    <ul><li class="x--Body-text-bullet">A simple hydroelectric-power
      station uses the downwards flow of water to generate
      electricity.</li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet">A hydroelectric-pumped
      storage scheme can also pump water back into the dam during
      times when there is electricity from other power stations
      that is not being used. Such a scheme plays the role of a
      rechargeable battery, is it stores electricity when it is not
      being used. It can also be used in the same way as a simple
      hydroelectric-power station to generate electricity, by
      letting water flow downwards out of the dam.</li>
    </ul><p class="x--Body-indent">Hydroelectricity is renewable and
    does not pollute the environment. Large-scale hydroelectric
    schemes are, however, expensive and require the construction of
    large dams that have an impact on the environment and
    communities. Imagine you lived along a river, and you were
    ordered to move because a hydroelectric dam was to be built
    there. How would you feel about it?</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Hydroelectric-power stations are able
    to come on line within three minutes. They are therefore
    convenient to use during times of the day when there is a very
    high demand for electricity, when this demand is more than the
    other power stations can provide.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Unfortunately, due to South Africa's
    limited water resources, only a small amount of electricity can
    be generated by hydroelectric-power stations.</p>

    <ul><li class="x--Body-text-bullet"><b>Reasons for using this type of energy source</b></li>
    </ul><p class="x--Body-indent">It is a renewable energy source and
    can be used to ensure the country has enough electricity during
    periods of high electricity consumption. Hydroelectric-power
    stations are cheap to operate, even cheaper than coal-fired
    power stations.</p>

    <ul><li class="x--Body-text-bullet"><b>Impact on the environment</b></li>
    </ul><p class="x--Body-indent">Dams and waterways need to be
    constructed for a hydroelectric-power station. It may be cheap
    to produce the electricity once the dam is completed, but the
    costs of building a dam are enormous, and the impact on the
    countryside can be severe.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">An environmental impact plan must be
    in place, and communities that could be affected have to be
    taken into consideration. Some people may even have to move
    because their houses and farms are located where the dam will
    be built.</p>

    <h4>Topic E: Wind turbines</h4>

    <p class="x--Body-text-1-3 para-style-override-30">For
    thousands of years, people have used windmills and energy
    derived from the wind to pump water and to grind mealies. After
    a breakthrough by scientists, wind can now also be used to
    generate electricity. Like the sun and water flowing down a
    river, this is a renewable energy source and does not
    negatively impact the environment or pollute it. Across the
    world, wind farms are being built. These are areas where wind
    is used to turn huge windmills that generate electricity.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3 para-style-override-30">Wind speed
    and direction change from day to day, depending on the weather
    and the season. When something changes in an unpredictable way,
    it is called "erratic". The patterns of wind direction and wind
    speed are studied and used for electricity generation in areas
    that have consistent winds. This does not mean that there has
    to be strong winds or gales for the system to work. What is
    needed is a steady wind that won't damage the machinery.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">In South Africa, research on the
    potential of wind energy as an electricity- generating option
    was carried out in various places. Different ways of generating
    electricity through wind were studied. An important factor is
    cost. It doesn't make sense to put systems in place that will
    make electricity too expensive to buy.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">After investigating all the options,
    ESKOM started the Klipheuwel Windfarm Research Facility on the
    West Coast near Cape Town in 2002.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">The generators need wind speeds of
    between 47 km and 57 km per hour for full power operation, but
    they can start generating electricity in winds as low as 11 km
    per hour. If a gale force wind blows, the turbines shut off
    automatically at winds over 90 km per hour to prevent damage to
    the generators.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Wind is an erratic resource that is
    not always available when needed.</p>

    <ul><li class="x--Body-text-bullet"><b>Reasons for using this type of energy source</b></li>
    </ul><p class="x--Body-indent">Wind is a renewable energy source,

    <h2>10.3 Transmission of electricity across the country</h2>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">The electricity that power stations
    generate is distributed across the whole country.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3">The map on the next page shows
    the main <b>transmission</b> lines that are used
    to <b>distribute</b>
    electricity from the power stations to different parts of the
    country.</p>

    <div class="aside">
      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent"><b>Transmission</b> means the action
      or process of sending something.</p>

      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent"><b>Distribution</b> refers to the
      action of sharing something among a number of recipients.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3">The combination of the
    transmission and the distribution cables form a network called
    the national grid. Electricity is fed into the national grid,
    and it has to be distributed across the country to cities,
    towns and rural areas.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">The South African government
    announced its policy to provide free basic services to the poor
    in 2000. The government has focused mainly on electricity
    supply, which has led to a higher demand on our national
    grid.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Electricity supply must be consistent
    and reliable, since electric equipment can be damaged if there
    are changes in the voltage and current.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">It is very difficult to store large
    quantities of electrical energy. The energy provider must
    always match the demand of the consumers. These consumers range
    from households to huge factories, transport systems and the
    use of heavy machinery.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Specific equipment has to be
    installed to ensure that the correct voltages reach the users.
    In this section, you are going to learn about this type of
    equipment.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">As the demand increases, more power
    stations must be brought on line. This means that the power
    they generate needs to be added to the national grid.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3">It is interesting to note that
    the electricity demand not only varies from day to day, but
    from minute to minute. The <b>peak demand</b> periods are early in
    the morning and in the evening.</p>

    <div class="aside">
      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent"><b>Peak demand</b> means the highest
      demand during a day.</p>

    electricity transmission in South Africa. Notice that the grid
    does not reach all rural areas. Electricity is generated

    <h4>Step-down and step-up transformers</h4>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">Electricity is transferred from power
    stations to consumers over long distances through the wires and
    cables of the national grid. When a current flows through a
    wire, a bit of energy is lost in the form of heat. The higher
    the current, the more energy is lost. To reduce these losses,
    the national grid transmits electricity at a low current, but
    this requires a high voltage. Remember Ohm's law!</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Step-up transformers are used at
    power stations to produce the very high voltages needed to
    transmit electricity through the national grid's power lines.
    When the electric energy reaches the consumer area, it is
    transformed, which means changed, to a lower and safer voltage.
    Step-down transformers are used locally in sub-stations to
    reduce the voltage to safe levels.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent para-style-override-5">If you don't
    quite understand this, think of water flowing through apipe.
    The wider the pipe, the more water can be pushed through. When
    it reaches the other end, the water is funnelled into smaller
    pipes to be used in homes and factories. The same principle is
    used to distribute electricity.</p>

    <div class="note">
      
      <ul><li class="x--Body-text-bullet">A transformer that
        increases the voltage is called "a step-up
        transformer".</li>

    <h3>
    Switches with OR-type control (15 minutes)</h3>

    <p class="x--Body-text-1-3 para-style-override-55">The circuit
    in Figure 9 has OR-type control. This type of control is used
    to switch on the light inside a car when you open one of the
    front doors. This is very useful when you get in or out of the
    car at night.</p>

    <div><figure>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3">The light turns on when the
    driver opens the door, and turns off when that door is closed.
    If a passenger gets in at the other front door, the light goes
    on again, even if the driver's door is closed.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">So the car has a circuit that
    switches on the light if <i>either</i> the driver's door is open
    <i>or</i> the passenger's
    door is open. This circuit has OR-type control.</p>

the bulb lights up if either the switch on the driver’s
door or the switch on the passenger’s door is closed
(on). It also lights up if they are both closed (on).
</p></div>

    <p class="x--Body-investigation-hanging">1. Look at the circuit
    in Figure 9. Both the switches are open (off). How can you get
    the bulb to light up? Think of three things you can do with the
    switches.</p>
    <hr/><p class="x--Body-indent para-style-override-13">The
    door-operated switch for the light inside the car is the same
    type of switch used for a fridge light, as shown in Figures 5
    and 6.</p>

    <h3>Truth
    tables (30 minutes)</h3>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">A computer gives many outputs depending
    on many inputs. To do this, it uses many AND-type and OR-type
    circuits inside a more complicated circuit. The AND and OR
    parts of the complicated circuits are called "logic gates".</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Computer designers and programmers
    need methods to write down all the possible "states" that the
    system can be in. A state is one possible combination of values
    for all the inputs. "Truth tables" help them to write down all
    the possible states. Computers have millions of possible
    states. But to understand the method of truth tables, you only
    need to understand the truth tables of systems with a small
    number of states.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Look back at Figure <span>8</span>,
    showing the electric paper-cutting machine. The operator has to
    press both switches to make the cutting blade move. So the
    circuit controlling the motor uses AND-type control.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Below is a truth table for this
    circuit. The inputs are the two switches. Each row of the table
    shows one possible combination of the inputs, and the output
    corresponding with it. So each row shows one possible
    state.</p>

    customers are happy with his low prices. He sells food and
    clothing cheaply because he co-operates with other shopkeepers
    in the area. They work together to negotiate with the big
    suppliers of clothing and food to get cheaper prices.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Sometimes Mr Abdullahi is alone in
    the shop. If he has to work in the office at the back of the
    shop, he closes the two front doors of the shop, but the doors
    are not locked. He will only know if someone comes in at one of
    the doors if he sees them or if they call him.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Can you make him an alarm system that
    will tell him when a door opens? Sometimes Mr Abdullahi has an
    assistant in the shop, and then he does not need an alarm, so
    he wants a switch to turn the alarm system on and off.</p>

    Draw a circuit diagram (15 minutes)</h3>

    <p class="x--Body-investigation-hanging">1. Should the alarm
    system use AND-control or OR-control? Explain.</p>
    <hr/><p class="x--Body-investigation-hanging">2. Often designers
    look at circuits that have already been designed, to see
    whether any of those circuits will do the job. Look at Figures
    7, 9 and 11 again. Which of these circuits will work?</p>
    <hr/><p class="x--Body-investigation-hanging para-style-override-7">
    3. Draw that circuit again in the space below. Give names for
    the different switches and show them as labels on your circuit

    <h3>Make a

    <p class="x--Body-Text">Make a model of the shop out of a

    have a roof, so that you can see inside it. Make the model as
    simple as possible, otherwise you will not have enough time to

    <h3>Make
    the switches for your alarm system (30 minutes)</h3>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">Make two of the door-operated push
    switches that you designed. Remember that they need to fit on
    the doors of your cardboard model of the shop.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Do not make a master switch, as you
    don't have enough time for that. You can simply connect two
    crocodile clips of conducting wires to "switch on" the master
    switch, and disconnect them to open the circuit and "switch
    off" the master switch.</p>

  
    <h3>Add
    your circuit to your model of the shop (30 minutes)</h3>

    <p class="x--Body-text-1-3">Now add all your circuit components
    and conducting wires to your cardboard model of the shop. Your
    design of the placement and wiring of the alarm system in
    Figure 13 will help you to connect all the circuit components
    in the correct way.</p>

   

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3">Stick the wires to the walls of
    the box with tape to make your model neat.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Connect all the circuit components.
