    refugees</span></h2>

    <p class="x--Body-text-1-3"><span>Emergency situations can
    cause large numbers of people to be forced from their homes.
    Emergencies not only affect people in areas where a disaster
    took place, but also the people in the area where the</span>
    <span class="Body-bold">refugees</span> <span>are moved to.
    People need shelter, water and food. A refugee camp has to be
    set up, and the camp needs to be very well planned</span>.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent"><span>In emergencies, plans to help
    refugees need to be</span><span>made very quickly to prevent
    further suffering. Two</span><span>types of emergency
    situations that force people to leave their homes are war and
    natural disasters</span>.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent"><span>In this lesson, you will learn
    about emergency situations and investigate ways to help

      another country.</span></p>
    </div>

    <p class="x--Body--above"><span class=
    "char-style-override-3">War</span></p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent"><span>Since the beginning of time,
    there have been wars between people all over the world. And
    while armies fight battles, people are forced to flee from
    their towns and villages. Over the centuries, many people have
    ended up as refugees. Even today, there are more than 3,8
    million refugees all over Africa. These people have been chased
    from their homes because of wars</span>.</p>

    <p class="x--Body--above"><span class=
    "char-style-override-3">Natural disasters</span></p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent"><span>Natural disasters are caused by
    nature and not by people. Floods, wildfires, earthquakes, and
    volcanic eruptions are all natural disasters. All of them can
    force people to leave their homes</span>.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent para-style-override-3"><span>Natural
    disasters usually happen with no warning. They can create
    emergencies very quickly, which means that people have to move
    to safer areas immediately</span>.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent para-style-override-3"><span>In 2000,
    a terrible flood hit Mozambique and destroyed huge areas of
    farming land. Thousands of people lost their farms and were
    forced to flee to dry ground. Refugee camps were set up in
    other parts of Mozambique and also in South Africa</span>.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent para-style-override-3"><span>Compare
    the pictures on the right. These pictures were taken from a
    satellite in space. They show the same area in Mozambique
    before and during the flood, and how much land was
    flooded</span>.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent"><span>A natural disaster can also
    happen over a longer period of time. In Africa, we rely on rain
    to water our crops. But this continent often has droughts.
    Droughts can create emergencies for farmers. During long
    droughts, large groups of people can be forced to leave their
    homes and their farms. These people then look for food, water
    and shelter, and they become refugees</span>.</p>

    <h2>6.2 <span>Initial problems facing refugees</span></h2>

    <p class="x--Body-Text"><span>Disasters such as floods and wars
    happen suddenly, which means that people have to leave their
    homes quickly. These refugees will not have a lot of food and
    water with them. They will also not have tools or materials to
    build shelters</span>.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent"><span>Emergencies that happen more
    slowly over longer periods of time include droughts, or long
    wars. Refugees in situations like these have a bit more time to
    pack up their possessions and plan their journey</span>.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3"><span>The type of emergency
    situation influences the</span> <span class="Body-bold">mix of
    people</span> <span>in a refugee camp. Sometimes, there will be
    more men than women. Other times, there will be many babies who
    are not able to walk yet and small children. And at other
    times, there will be many elderly people who need special help
    and care</span>.</p>

      different types of people in a group, such as the young and
      the old, male and female and disabled people.</span></p>
    </div>

    <p class="x--Body-indent"><span>For example, during a war,
    there are usually fewer men at home, because the men will be
    fighting. And during a drought, babies and elderly people may
    die since they are more vulnerable</span>.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent"><span>Different people have different
    needs for food, water and shelter. Children become dehydrated
    more quickly than adults and they also need more high-energy
    foods. Old people need more warmth and blankets</span>.</p>

    <p class="x--Head-investigation">Next week</p>

    <p class="x--Body-Text"><span>One of the biggest problems
    facing refugee camps is to provide enough nutritious food.
    Nutritious food provides all the nutrients your body needs to
    stay healthy</span>.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Think about these questions to
    prepare for next week's lesson:</p>

    <ul>
      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet"><span class=

      <span>Which foods would you choose to feed a large camp of
      refugees?</span></li>
    </ul>

    <p class="x--Body-opener"><span>In the previous chapter, you
    learnt about refugees and why large numbers of people can be
    forced to leave their homes and their countries. Usually,
    refugees have little or no possessions. They can also not carry
    enough food for a long period of time. In this chapter, you
    will learn how to process food for emergency situations.
    Processed foods last much longer than fresh foods and are ideal
    for refugee camps. You will write a design brief and plan an
    emergency meal that is nutritious and tasty. It should be
    possible to make this emergency meal in a refugee
    camp</span>.</p>

    <h2>7.1 Investigate types of food</h2>

    <p class="x--Body-Text"><span>When refugees travel to a host
    country, the people in the host country usually take care of
    them</span>.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">In the previous chapter, you looked
    at the mix of people and how this mix would change, depending
    on whether the emergency was caused by a natural disaster or a
    war.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">The type of food refugees eat depends
    on the mix of the group. Children need more protein than older
    people, babies need special milk formulas, and old people need
    lots of vegetables to protect them from disease.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">For homework, you had to think about
    types of food that are available in South Africa and that can
    feed a large group of people. The food had to be cheap, easy to
    find and nutritious.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent"><span>Refugees do not expect
    expensive food, just enough healthy food. Bad nutrition can
    lead to problems like illness and disease. If refugees get weak
    or sick, they will not be able to look after themselves and the
    situation in the refugee camp will become worse</span>.</p>

    <p class="x--Body--above"><span class=
    "char-style-override-3">Nutritious food</span></p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent"><span>To remain healthy, the human
    body needs different types of food known as food groups. Meals
    that contain the right combination of the different food groups
    are called balanced meals. A balanced meal includes the
    following food groups</span>:</p>

    <ul>
      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet"><span class=
      "char-style-override-5">&#226;&#8364;&#162;</span>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet"><span class=
      "char-style-override-5">&#226;&#8364;&#162;</span>
      <span>Protein: These build muscle and give us strength.
      Protein-rich foods include meat, fish, chicken, eggs, beans,

      and oils: These provide energy and help to protect our
      internal organs. They also help our bodies to fight disease.
      Foods in this food group include cheese, butter, margarine
      and oils such as sunflower or canola oil.</span></li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet"><span class=

    called writing your steps in sequence. Write the steps one

    <p class="x--Body-indent"><span>But first, write down how or
    why you will do each step. How you will do a step is called an

    <p class="x--Body-opener para-style-override-30">Shack dwellers
    face many problems. Fires are particularly dangerous. Shack
    fires kill many people every year. People in shacks use open
    fires and candles for heat and light. When a candle falls over
    or an open fire is not dampened down to kill all the flames, a
    fire starts. These fires spread very quickly because shacks are
    built too close to each other. There are also no proper roads
    in between the shacks. This makes it difficult for fire
    fighters to reach the fires in order to put the fires out.</p>

    <p class="x--Head-C">Investigate part 1</p>

    <p class="x--Head-investigation para-style-override-32">Let us
    look how our ancestors lived (30 minutes)</p>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">The Khoi (Khoikhoi or KhoeKhoe), which
    means "people people", and the San (Bushmen or Sho), which
    means "men without domestic livestock", were the first people
    to live in southern Africa. They were the earliest inhabitants
    of our country and have been living here for thousands of
    years.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Both groups were nomadic. Nomads do
    not live in one place for a long time. They move from a place
    in search of food for themselves and their animals. The Khoi
    people owned livestock. They moved in search of good grazing
    for their cattle and goats. The San people were
    hunter-gatherers. They did not have livestock. The men tracked
    and hunted wild animals. The women collected mainly eggs, roots
    and bulbs.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Both groups built <span>dome-shaped
    huts</span> made from green sticks tied together at the top.
    These frame structures were covered with reeds and grasses
    which grew around them. Some of the Khoi wove grass into mats,
    which they used to cover the frames. The grasses or reeds made
    the huts windproof and waterproof. When they moved on they left
    the huts behind, so their huts were not made to last a long
    time. These were not permanent dwellings.</p>

    Dwellings in informal settlements (30 \times 2 = 60
    minutes)</p>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">Many people migrate from rural areas to
    large towns and cities looking for a better life. They arrive
    with no money and no place to live. They build temporary places
    to live on open pieces of land near the towns. As more people
    arrive, more houses are built until there is a whole group of
    houses close to each other. We call this group of houses an
    informal settlement.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3">These informal settlements have
    no roads, no water supply, no toilet facilities and no waste
    removal. These temporary houses are commonly called shacks.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3">People use materials that they
    find in scrap yards and what they can afford to buy. Some
