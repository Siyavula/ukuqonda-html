    <h2 id="toc-id-1">1.1 What is magnetism?</h2>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">Some people use fridge magnets to keep
    notes or lists on the fridge's door. You even get magnets in
    the shape of words or letters that you can put on a fridge door
    to play with. The magnets make the letters stick to the metal
    of the fridge door.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Can you think of other ways in which
    magnets can help us in our daily lives?</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">In this chapter, you will learn about
    different types of magnets and how we use them in everyday
    life.</p>
<div class="aside">
      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent"><span class="char-style-override-1"><b>Magnetism</b></span> is a force that can
      attract (bring closer) or repel (push away) objects that have
      a magnetic material like iron inside them.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3">Thousands of years ago, humans
    discovered that a certain type of rock could attract iron. This
    rock was called lodestone. People believed that it had magical
    powers! Pieces of lodestone would also push or pull other
    pieces of lodestone.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3">The ability to attract iron is
    called <b>magnetism</b>.</p>

    

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3">We now know that lodestone
    contains a material called magnetite, which is a kind of iron
    oxide. Iron oxides are chemical compounds of iron and oxygen.
    &#8220;Lodestone&#8221;  is a natural magnet.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3">All magnets are able to attract
    other magnets or magnetic objects. Magnetic objects consist of
    iron or some other metals.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3">Experiment with a magnet to pick
    up paperclips. You will notice that if you hold the magnet far
    away, nothing happens. If you move the magnet closer to the
    paperclips, the paperclips will suddenly stick to the
    magnet.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Think about these questions:</p>

    <ul><li class="x--Body-text-bullet"> What is it
      about a magnet that attracts these particular objects?<hr/></li>
    <li class="x--Body-text-bullet"> Does a
      magnet have to touch a magnetic object to attract it?<hr/></li></ul>
    <p class="x--Body--above para-style-override-1">To find out

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3 para-style-override-3">Put the
    ruler flat on your desk. Place a paperclip so that it is in
    line with the zero mark of the ruler. Put one magnet at the
    other end of the ruler. Slowly push the magnet toward the
    paperclip, as shown in the picture. The moment the paperclip
    moves towards the magnet, stop moving it.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">A magnet has an invisible magnetic
    field around it. The field is stronger close to the magnet, and
    weaker further away. The magnet does not affect the paperclip
    until the paperclip is close enough to be within this
    field.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Stronger magnets can attract magnetic
    materials from further away than weaker magnets can. This is
    because a stronger magnet has a larger magnetic field.</p>

    <h2 id="toc-id-2">1.2 Permanent magnets and the magnetic
    fields</h2>

    <p class="x--Body-Text para-style-override-4">You have learnt
    that magnets can pull certain objects towards them because the
    objects have a magnetic field around them. An object that a
    magnet moves becomes a "temporary" magnet. A temporary magnet
    is not a magnet all the time. When you move the paperclip
    within the magnetic field of the magnet, the paperclip also
    becomes a magnet. The paperclip loses its magnetic field
    quickly.</p>

    only as long as it is in the magnetic field of a permanent

    <p class="x--Body-indent">A lodestone is a natural permanent
    magnet. You investigate permanent magnets that have been made
    artificially. These magnets have a north end and a south end,

    shapes of magnets that you will use: bar magnets and horseshoe
    magnets.</p>

    north pole on one end of the bar and a south pole on the
    opposite end of the bar. This means that the poles are far
    apart.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Horseshoe magnets also have a north
    and a south pole, but the bar has been bent into a curved
    shape. This bend brings the north and south poles closer
    together than they would be in a bar magnet.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Let us investigate what the north and
    south poles of the magnet mean.</p>

    <h3>Investigating magnet poles</h3>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">For this investigation, you will need
    two bar magnets, with the north and south poles marked. Work in
    small groups.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-investigation-hanging--1-3- para-style-override-5">1.
    Hold a bar magnet in one hand and put another bar magnet on
    your desk. Bring the north end of the magnet in your hand close
    to the north end of the magnet on the desk. Write down what
    happens when you bring the north poles of the two bar magnets
    closer together.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">You should have noticed that as the
    north poles were brought together, there was a "resistance" to
    getting too close. This is why you found it difficult to get
    the north or south poles to touch each other. However, when you
    bring the north pole close to the south pole, they pull towards
    each other.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">When the poles are the same, the
    force pushes them apart, but when the poles are different, the
    force pulls them together. So a north pole and a south pole
    attract each other, while a north and a north pole or a south
    and a south pole repel each other<span class="char-style-override-5">.</span></p>

    <h3>Visualising magnetic fields
    (extension)</h3>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">Although we cannot see magnetic fields,
    we can detect them using iron filings. Work in small groups to
    do this investigation.</p>

    <p class="x--Body--above"><b>You will need
    the following for this activity:</b></p>

    <ul><li class="x--Body-text-bullet">  two bar
      magnets,</li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet">  a piece of
      firm white paper, just bigger than the magnets, and</li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet">  iron
      filings.</li>
    </ul><p class="x--Body-indent">Iron filings are tiny pieces of iron
    that look like a fine powder. Be careful-
    the filings will stick to the magnets, so you must make sure
    that you keep a piece of paper between the magnets and the
    filings at all times.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-investigation-hanging">1. Put one of the bar
    magnets on the table in front of you.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-investigation-hanging">2. Put the piece of
    white paper over the magnet.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-investigation-hanging">3. Lightly draw the
    outline of the bar magnet on the paper, and mark the positions
    of the north and south poles.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-investigation-hanging">4. Carefully sprinkle
    the iron filings onto the paper in the area of the magnet.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-investigation-hanging">You should see the
    iron filings making a pattern around the magnet. Gently spread
    the iron filings around the magnet so that you can see the
    whole pattern. Notice the places where there are lots of iron
    filings very close together and the places where the iron
    filings are more spread out.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-investigation-hanging para-style-override-10">5. Use
    the space below to draw the pattern that the iron filings
    make.</p><div><img class="frame-20" src="Tech_English_LB_Grade7_term3_1-web-resources/image/makeasketch.png" alt="makeasketch.png"/></div>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">The iron filings show you the pattern
    of the magnetic field. Each tiny piece of iron behaves like a
    magnet and lines up with the magnetic field around the bar
    magnet.</p>

    magnetic field pattern for yourself, here is a photograph of
    iron filings around one bar magnet:</p>

        away from the magnet the lines get further and further
        apart, showing that the field is much weaker.</li>
      </ul></div>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Now repeat the steps using two bar
    magnets with the north and south poles labelled. Put the north
    pole of one magnet close to the south pole of the other magnet.

magnetism
</h1>


    <p class="x--Body-opener">In Chapter 1 you learnt about magnets
    and magnetism. Now you will investigate which metals are
    attracted to magnets and which are not. You will also learn why
    it is good to recycle scrap metal and how this important work
    is done.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-opener">We can also recycle materials other
    than metal. Plastic, paper, cardboard and other materials that
    are often thrown away could be recycled instead. Since we are
    running out of basic resources, we need to reuse or recycle as
    much as we can instead of simply throwing things away.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-opener">You will start work on a recycling
    plan for your school by recording the waste produced by your
    school and how much of it could have been recycled. Many
    factories use waste materials, so you can develop a plan to
    raise funds for your school by recycling waste.</p>

    If you said only three, then you are correct. They are steel,
    iron and nickel, and they all contain iron and are magnetic.
    Any metal containing iron and that is magnetic, is called a
    <span class="char-style-override-4"><b>ferrous metal</b></span>.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3">Many people think that tin is
    magnetic, but it is not. The tins that you buy food and other
    household goods in are actually made of very thin steel and are
    covered with another thin layer of tin to stop them from
    corroding. Steel is a mixture of iron and carbon. When you
    place a magnet next to a tin can, it is attracted to the iron
    in the steel, not the tin.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3 para-style-override-18">At home,
    make sure that all small metal objects, such as empty tins, are
    collected separately and sent to recycling centres. Bigger
    objects such as old household appliances will be collected by
    scrap metal dealers. Scrap metal dealers sort the different
    types of metals they collect into piles and send these to the
    factories. The factories then melt down the metal objects so

</figcaption></figure>
    <p class="x--Body-indent">Can you see how a magnet can be used
    to help sort piles of metal? Scrap dealers use large magnets to
    pull out the magnetic metals from the piles. This speeds up the
    process.</p>

    <p class="x--Body--above"><b>Making money
    from recycling</b></p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">To encourage people not to waste
    valuable materials that can be recycled, scrap metal dealers
    will pay for scrap metal. They usually pay by mass, so it
    doesn't really matter what shape or form the metal comes in, it
    is the mass that counts.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">But this can create problems too.
    Some people steal metal objects such as steel manhole covers
    and copper wire from telephone and electricity cables, to try
    and make money. Stealing these articles is not only dishonest,
    but it also puts other people in danger. If manhole covers are
    stolen, then there are holes in the roads that people can drive
    or fall <span>into. Stolen electricity cables can cause loss of
    power.</span></p>

    <h3>Collecting scrap metal
    honestly</h3>

    <p class="x--Body-investigation-hanging para-style-override-9">
    1. Do you think there are metal items that scrap metal dealers
    should not accept from people trying to sell them? Discuss your
    ideas with another learner. Write down the items you think
    scrap metal dealers should not buy.</p>
     <hr/><p class="x--Body-investigation-hanging para-style-override-9">
    2. <span>List a few scrap metal objects that people can collect
    to sell to scrap metal dealers.</span></p>
     <hr/><p class="x--Body-investigation-hanging">3. If you were
    collecting scrap metal to sell to a scrap metal dealer, how
    would you show that you had gathered the items legally? Here is
    an example: "I would get the owner of the house to give me a
    letter saying that she gave me the items."</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent para-style-override-19">Write down any
    other steps you could take.</p>
     <hr/> 
    <h4>Identifying
    recyclable materials</h4>
    <p class="x--Body-indent">Scrap metal is not the only
    recyclable material. Most waste can be recycled. There are
    companies that specialise in collecting all forms of recyclable
    waste, and this serves the community in many ways.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">In the last section of this chapter,
    you are going to investigate what a recycling scheme for your
    school will achieve. Before you start collecting materials,
    discuss in the class which waste materials the school produces
    could be recycled. Remember that it is not only your classroom,
    but the whole school.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Get one learner to write these items
    on the <span>board</span>, with a few examples of the materials
    you are likely to find at school.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent"><b>For example</b>:</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent"><b>Plastic:</b> milk bottles, cold
    drink bottles.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent"><b>Cardboard:</b> food cartons,
    boxes.</p>

  <h4>How much
    recyclable waste is produced by the school?</h4>

    <ul><li class="x--Body-text-bullet">  For the
      next week, keep a record of the amount of waste that the
      school produces.</li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet para-style-override-20">
          It would
        be helpful if the rest of the school knows that you are
        collecting recyclable waste. Ask your principal if you can
        have a special waste bin or small area where
        <span>learners</span> can bring their recyclable waste. If
        your school has extra waste bins, you could put them next
        to the normal bins and put recycling labels on them.

      
      </li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet">  Collect
      the recyclable material and sort it into piles. Put this
      recyclable material into black bags. Tie each bag when it is
      full and mark them clearly. Get advice from your teacher on
      where to store the material while you are collecting it.</li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet">  Find out
      if there are scrap dealers near you or your school who will
      collect the waste, and ask them how much they will pay for
      the various types of material.</li>
    </ul>  <div class="aside">
          <p class="x--Body-box-heading"><b>Safety</b></p>

          <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent">When you are collecting
          waste materials, always wear gloves. Wash your hands
          thoroughly after you have finished sorting the
          material.</p>

    <h4>Making money from
    recycling</h4>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">You have been collecting and storing
    recyclable waste for one week. Now do the following exercises
    as a class:</p>

    <ul><li class="x--Body-text-bullet">  Gather all
      the waste you have collected and make sure it is correctly
      sorted: one pile for paper, one pile for cardboard, one pile
      for plastic.</li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet">  Place the
      piles into bags and mark them carefully according to what is
      in the bag.</li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet">  Weigh the
      various types of material. Work out the total amount of each
      material that you have.</li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet">  Multiply
      the weight of the material by the value the scrap dealer said
      <span>he or she</span> would pay for that material.
      <p><b>For example:</b></p><p>3 kg aluminium
      tins at R3,50 per kg: R3,50 &#215; 3 = R10,50</p></li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet">  Total all
      the amounts for all of the materials.</li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet">  Discuss
      ways you could improve the collecting system.</li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet">  Discuss
      ways to make sure the whole school is involved and interested
      in this project.</li>
    </ul><h4>Write an
    individual report on the value of recycling for your
    school</h4>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">You have worked as a class to see how
    much recyclable material can be collected over a week from the

    <p class="x--Body-investigation-hanging">5. What scrap dealer
    or recycling company will collect the material, and how much

    <p class="x--Body-investigation-hanging">6. Should you bring
    extra material from home or other collection points to add to
    the piles each week to make more money?</p>

    <p class="x--Body-investigation-hanging">7. Should you involve
    the whole school in the project?</p>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">An electric circuit needs three basic
    things to work:</p>

    <p class="x--Body-investigation-hanging">1. An energy source.
    This can be a cell or a stronger power source.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-investigation-hanging">2. A complete circuit.
    There has to be an unbroken pathway of conducting materials
    through which the electrical current can flow.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-investigation-hanging">3. A load. There has

    the form of a light bulb, a resistor, a motor or other
    electrical components.</p>

    which are those that contain iron, are still valuable. It takes
    a lot of time to sort waste material by hand.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3 para-style-override-26">As you
    learnt last week, ferrous metals are attracted to magnets. An
    electromagnet is passed through the waste material and all the
    ferrous metals stick to it. The electromagnet is then moved
    over a collection bin. When the electromagnet is switched off,
    the ferrous metals are no longer attracted to it and they fall
    into the bin.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3 para-style-override-26">Apart from
    being useful to sort scrap metal, electromagnets are often used
    as components in other electrical devices. Some examples
    include:</p>

    <ul><li class="x--Body-text-bullet para-style-override-27">
        in motors:
      to rotate the motor.</li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet para-style-override-27">
        in
      loudspeakers: an electromagnet responds to the sound signals
      and amplifies them.</li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet para-style-override-27">
        in
      computer hard drives: electromagnetism is used to write and
      store data.</li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet para-style-override-27">

        in a

    </ul><p class="x--Body-indent">In all of these applications, the
    fact that the magnetic force can be controlled by switching the
    electric circuit on and off is the property that makes the
    electromagnet so useful.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent para-style-override-28">Now let us
    look at a simple electromagnet in the classroom. Your teacher
    can do this experiment as a demonstration.</p>

    <h3>Make a simple
    electromagnet</h3>

    <p><b>For this
    activity, you will need the following objects:</b></p>

    <ul><li class="x--Body-text-bullet">  a long
      iron nail, about 15 cm long. If you don't have a long nail,
      you can make a bundle of several pieces of iron wire,</li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet">  3 m of
      insulated copper wire,</li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet">  a D-cell
      cell,</li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet">  wire
      stripper, and</li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet">  metal
      paperclips.</li>
    </ul><p class="x--Body-investigation-hanging">1. Use the wire
    stripper to strip a small piece of the insulation from both
    ends of the insulated copper wire.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-investigation-hanging">2. Neatly wrap the
    iron nail with the insulated wire. Make sure that you keep the
    wire turning in the same direction. Keep the coils close
    together.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-investigation-hanging--1-3-">4. Wrap the
    other stripped end around the negative terminal of your
    cell.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-investigation-hanging--1-3-">5. To test if
    your electromagnet is working, see whether it can pick up
    paperclips. If the paperclips are attracted to the iron rod,
    then your electromagnet is working!</p> <hr/>

    <div class="aside">
      <p class="x--Body-box-heading"><b>Safety note:</b></p>

      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent">The iron nail can become
      quite hot, so be careful not to burn your hands!</p>
    </div>
   <p class="x--Body-investigation-hanging">6. Once you have
    tested your electromagnet, disconnect the wire from one
    terminal of the cell. Now try to pick up the paperclips. Are
    the paperclips attracted to the iron rod?</p>
    <hr/> <p class="x--Body-investigation-hanging">7. How can you use the
    electromagnet to pick up paperclips from one place and then put
    them in a different place?</p>
    <hr/> 
    <h4>How does an
    electromagnet work?</h4>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">There is a strong relationship
    between electricity and magnetism. The electricity in the wire
    coils creates a magnetic field. The iron nail is right in the
    middle of this magnetic field. Because the iron nail is a
    ferromagnetic material, it becomes magnetised by the field. The
    magnetic field from the electric current is made much larger,
    or amplified, by the magnetic field in the iron nail. Without
    the iron core, the magnetic field would be very weak. When the
    electric current is switched off, the iron nail loses its
    magnetism.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-opener"><span>In this chapter, you will learn
    how simple mechanisms can be combined to make complex machines
    that are useful. You will learn about a mechanism called a

    from ropes and cables</span></h2>

    <p class="x--Body-Text"><span>Look at Figure 4. A man is
    lifting a heavy bag. He is using a rope wrapped around a pulley
    so that he can pull down to lift the bag, instead of lifting
    the bag up. The pulley makes it possible for the rope to change
    the direction in which the rope pulls. When he pulls down on
    the rope, he can lean with his weight on the rope to make it
    easier to pull the bag up. But there is no mechanical advantage
    in this situation</span>.</p>

    and non-magnetic metals into separate piles for recycling. They
    use a crane with a magnet, but find it difficult to remove the

      short pieces of iron wire for a soft core;</li>

      You can use four 1,5 V D-cells. We use D-cells instead of 1,5
      V AA-cells (penlight batteries), because the D-cells contain
      more material and therefore last longer.</li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet">  a battery
      holder. The cells must be connected in series, one behind the
      other for them to provide 6 V of power. You can use
      insulation tape to tape them together.</li>
