Emergency situations

    <p class="x--Body-opener"><span>In this chapter, you will learn
    about emergency situations and the effects they have on people.
    People are sometimes forced to leave their homes because of
    emergencies. They then become refugees. You will learn how
    sheltered, safe areas are created for refugees and how aid
    workers provide food and water</span>.</p>

    <h2>6.1 <span>Situations that cause people to become
    refugees</span></h2>

    <p class="x--Body-text-1-3"><span>Emergency situations can
    cause large numbers of people to be forced from their homes.
    Emergencies not only affect people in areas where a disaster
    took place, but also the people in the area where the</span>
    <span class="Body-bold"><b>refugees</b></span> <span>are moved to.
    People need shelter, water and food. A refugee camp has to be
    set up, and the camp needs to be very well planned</span>.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent"><span>In emergencies, plans to help
    refugees need to be</span><span>made very quickly to prevent
    further suffering. Two</span><span>types of emergency
    situations that force people to leave their homes are war and
    natural disasters</span>.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent"><span>In this lesson, you will learn
    about emergency situations and investigate ways to help
    refugees</span>.</p>

      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent"><span class="char-style-override-2"><b>Refugees:</b></span> <span>People who are
      forced to leave their homes during a disaster or in an
      emergency situation. Sometimes, refugees move to a safe area
      that is close by, and at other times, they have to travel to
      another country.</span></p>
    </div>

    <p><b>War</b></p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent"><span>Since the beginning of time,
    there have been wars between people all over the world. And
    while armies fight battles, people are forced to flee from
    their towns and villages. Over the centuries, many people have
    ended up as refugees. Even today, there are more than 3,8
    million refugees all over Africa. These people have been chased
    from their homes because of wars</span>.</p>

    <p class="x--Body--above"><span class="char-style-override-3"><b>Natural disasters</b></span></p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent"><span>Natural disasters are caused by
    nature and not by people. Floods, wildfires, earthquakes, and
    volcanic eruptions are all natural disasters. All of them can
    force people to leave their homes</span>.</p>

</figcaption></figure>
    <p class="x--Body-indent para-style-override-3"><span>Natural
    disasters usually happen with no warning. They can create
    emergencies very quickly, which means that people have to move
    to safer areas immediately</span>.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent para-style-override-3"><span>In 2000,
    a terrible flood hit Mozambique and destroyed huge areas of
    farming land. Thousands of people lost their farms and were
    forced to flee to dry ground. Refugee camps were set up in
    other parts of Mozambique and also in South Africa</span>.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent para-style-override-3"><span>Compare
    the pictures on the right. These pictures were taken from a
    satellite in space. They show the same area in Mozambique
    before and during the flood, and how much land was
    flooded</span>.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent"><span>A natural disaster can also
    happen over a longer period of time. In Africa, we rely on rain
    to water our crops. But this continent often has droughts.
    Droughts can create emergencies for farmers. During long
    droughts, large groups of people can be forced to leave their
    homes and their farms. These people then look for food, water
    and shelter, and they become refugees</span>.</p>

    <h2>6.2 <span>Initial problems facing refugees</span></h2>

    <p class="x--Body-Text"><span>Disasters such as floods and wars
    happen suddenly, which means that people have to leave their
    homes quickly. These refugees will not have a lot of food and
    water with them. They will also not have tools or materials to
    build shelters</span>.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent"><span>Emergencies that happen more
    slowly over longer periods of time include droughts, or long
    wars. Refugees in situations like these have a bit more time to
    pack up their possessions and plan their journey</span>.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3"><span>The type of emergency
    situation influences the</span> <span class="Body-bold"><b>mix of
    people</b></span> <span>in a refugee camp. Sometimes, there will be
    more men than women. Other times, there will be many babies who
    are not able to walk yet and small children. And at other
    times, there will be many elderly people who need special help
    and care</span>.</p>

    <div class="aside">
      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent"><span class="char-style-override-2"><b>Mix of people:</b></span> <span>The
      different types of people in a group, such as the young and
      the old, male and female and disabled people.</span></p>
    </div>

    <p class="x--Body-indent"><span>For example, during a war,
    there are usually fewer men at home, because the men will be
    fighting. And during a drought, babies and elderly people may
    die since they are more vulnerable</span>.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent"><span>Different people have different
    needs for food, water and shelter. Children become dehydrated
    more quickly than adults and they also need more high-energy
    foods. Old people need more warmth and blankets</span>.</p>

    <h2>6.3 <span>Refugees in a foreign land</span></h2>

    <p class="x--Body-Text"><span>When refugees arrive at a refugee
    camp, they need many things, such as food, clean water and
    shelter. These basic needs have to be supplied by the rescue
    workers who are setting up the refugee camp</span>.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent"><span>In the following exercise, you
    will look at the experiences of people on either side of a
    refugee situation: refugees and the rescue and aid workers who
    are helping them</span>.</p>

    <h3>Situation: Refugees in a
    foreign land</h3>

    <p class="x--Body-Text"><span>Discuss the situation below in
    groups of three or four before answering the questions
    yourself. Your answers should be short paragraphs</span>.</p>

    <div class="note"><p>
      A sudden war has broken out between two small
countries in central Africa and a large number of
people had to flee to a neighbouring country.
Imagine what it must be like to be one of the
refugees, and also what the situation would be like
for the <b>host</b> nation.</p>

    <div class="aside">
      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent"><span class="char-style-override-2"><b>Host:</b></span> <span>A person who gives
      food, water and shelter to another person. A host nation is a

    </div>

    <p class="x--Body-investigation-hanging">1. <span>What do you
    think the mix of people in the group is like? Remember this is
    a war situation, and people had to flee from their country.
    Think about the ages of the refugees and write down which
    groups will need the most care and attention</span>.</p>

    <hr/><p class="x--Body-investigation-hanging">2. <span>What are
    their needs for shelter? Remember that they have not brought
    many possessions with them. Who will provide the shelters or
    the materials needed to build them</span>?</p>

   <hr/><p class="x--Body-investigation-hanging">3. <span>What food and
    supplies do the refugees need? Remember that the refugees have
    been travelling on foot for long periods of time. Think about
    the ages of the people. Will some of them need more food and
    water than others, and if so, why? Will some people have
    special needs, and if so, why?</span></p><hr/>

   
    
    <h3>Next week</h3>

    <p class="x--Body-Text"><span>One of the biggest problems
    facing refugee camps is to provide enough nutritious food.
    Nutritious food provides all the nutrients your body needs to
    stay healthy</span>.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Think about these questions to
    prepare for next week's lesson:</p>

    <ul><li class="x--Body-text-bullet"> 
      <span>Which foods are the easiest to find in your
      area?</span></li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet">

    <h1> 7 
Processing food for
emergency situations
</h1>
    
    
    <p class="x--Body-opener"><span>In the previous chapter, you
    learnt about refugees and why large numbers of people can be
    forced to leave their homes and their countries. Usually,
    refugees have little or no possessions. They can also not carry
    enough food for a long period of time. In this chapter, you
    will learn how to process food for emergency situations.
    Processed foods last much longer than fresh foods and are ideal
    for refugee camps. You will write a design brief and plan an
    emergency meal that is nutritious and tasty. It should be
    possible to make this emergency meal in a refugee
    camp</span>.</p>

    <h2>7.1 Investigate types of food</h2>

    <p class="x--Body-Text"><span>When refugees travel to a host
    country, the people in the host country usually take care of
    them</span>.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">In the previous chapter, you looked
    at the mix of people and how this mix would change, depending
    on whether the emergency was caused by a natural disaster or a
    war.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">The type of food refugees eat depends
    on the mix of the group. Children need more protein than older
    people, babies need special milk formulas, and old people need
    lots of vegetables to protect them from disease.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">For homework, you had to think about
    types of food that are available in South Africa and that can
    feed a large group of people. The food had to be cheap, easy to
    find and nutritious.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent"><span>Refugees do not expect
    expensive food, just enough healthy food. Bad nutrition can
    lead to problems like illness and disease. If refugees get weak
    or sick, they will not be able to look after themselves and the
    situation in the refugee camp will become worse</span>.</p>

    <p><b>Nutritious food</b></p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent"><span>To remain healthy, the human
    body needs different types of food known as food groups. Meals
    that contain the right combination of the different food groups
    are called balanced meals. A balanced meal includes the
    following food groups</span>:</p>

    <ul><li class="x--Body-text-bullet"> 
      C<span>arbohydrates: These provide energy and are found in
      starchy foods like potatoes, mealie meal, rice and
      bread.</span></li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet"> 
      <span>Protein: These build muscle and give us strength.
      Protein-rich foods include meat, fish, chicken, eggs, beans,
      cheese and milk.</span></li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet">  <span>Fats
      and oils: These provide energy and help to protect our
      internal organs. They also help our bodies to fight disease.
      Foods in this food group include cheese, butter, margarine
      and oils such as sunflower or canola oil.</span></li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet"> 
      <span>Vitamins and minerals: These are found in all foods,
      but especially in fresh fruit and vegetables. They are very
      important for good health, strong bones and teeth, and to
      keep your brain working well. Vitamins also help to prevent
      disease. For example, Vitamin C, which is found in oranges
      and lemons, fights colds and flu.</span></li>
    </ul><p><b>Balanced diets</b></p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent"><span>Have a look at the drawing
    below and see if you can tell which foods are high in
    carbohydrates, protein, fats and oils, and vitamins and
    minerals. Notice that similar types of foods are grouped
    together. Also notice that the groups are of similar size
    or</span>
    <span>"</span><span>proportion</span><span>"</span><span>. The
    drawing shows that we need to eat similar proportions of food
    from all of the five food groups every day to stay
    healthy</span><span>.</span></p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent"><span>You can think of nutrition as a
    wheel where each type of food is an important part</span>.</p>

    fires kill many people every year. People in shacks use open
    fires and candles for heat and light. When a candle falls over

    fire starts. These fires spread very quickly because shacks are
    built too close to each other. There are also no proper roads
    in between the shacks. This makes it difficult for fire
    fighters to reach the fires in order to put the fires out.</p>

    <h2>Week 1</h2>

    <h4>Investigate part 1</h4>

    <h3>Let us
    look how our ancestors lived (30 minutes)</h3>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">The Khoi (Khoikhoi or KhoeKhoe), which
    means "people people", and the San (Bushmen or Sho), which
    means "men without domestic livestock", were the first people
    to live in southern Africa. They were the earliest inhabitants
    of our country and have been living here for thousands of
    years.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Both groups were nomadic. Nomads do
    not live in one place for a long time. They move from a place
    in search of food for themselves and their animals. The Khoi
    people owned livestock. They moved in search of good grazing
    for their cattle and goats. The San people were
    hunter-gatherers. They did not have livestock. The men tracked
    and hunted wild animals. The women collected mainly eggs, roots
    and bulbs.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Both groups built <span>dome-shaped
    huts</span> made from green sticks tied together at the top.
    These frame structures were covered with reeds and grasses
    which grew around them. Some of the Khoi wove grass into mats,
    which they used to cover the frames. The grasses or reeds made
    the huts windproof and waterproof. When they moved on they left
    the huts behind, so their huts were not made to last a long
    time. These were not permanent dwellings.</p>

    Permanent homes of our indigenous people (30 minutes)</h3>

    <p class="x--Body-text-1-3">About 2000 years ago, people slowly
    <b>migrated</b> from
    northern Africa to the south. Four main groups ended up in the
    area that is now South Africa: Nguni, Sotho, Venda and
    Tsonga.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3">These are the forefathers of most
    of our <b>indigenous</b>
    cultures. They grew crops, mainly grains like maize for food.
    They kept cattle for meat and milk. So they needed to live
    close to rivers or streams and in areas where the land was
    fertile.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Because they lived in one place, they

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet">  covering

    <h3>
    Dwellings in informal settlements (30 &#215; 2 = 60
    minutes)</h3>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">Many people migrate from rural areas to
    large towns and cities looking for a better life. They arrive
    with no money and no place to live. They build temporary places
    to live on open pieces of land near the towns. As more people
    arrive, more houses are built until there is a whole group of
    houses close to each other. We call this group of houses an
    informal settlement.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3">These informal settlements have
    no roads, no water supply, no toilet facilities and no waste
    removal. These temporary houses are commonly called shacks.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3">People use materials that they
    find in scrap yards and what they can afford to buy. Some
    examples are: cardboard, plastic sheeting, wooden planks, old
    tyres, pieces of polystyrene foam and sheets of corrugated

    <h3>Let us
    help the disaster management team (30 minutes)</h3>

    <p class="x--Body-story"><b><i>The scenario</i></b></p>

    <p class="x--Body-story"><i>The disaster management team wants to
    be better prepared for emergency situations. They need
    emergency shelters that can be moved easily to disaster areas.
    The shelters will be stored until there is a need for them.
    They must be set up and packed away quickly and easily.</i></p>

    <p class="x--Body-story"><i>The health of the disaster victims who
    will be housed in the shelters is important. The shelters have
    to be sturdy and windproof and waterproof. They
    must be safe and large enough for six people to live in for up
    to a month.</i></p>

    <p class="x--Body--above">They have asked for help with a
    design. The specifications are:</p>

    <div class="note">
      <ul><li class="x--Body-text-bullet">  design a
        shelter,</li>

        <li class="x--Body-text-bullet">  build a

        <li class="x--Body-text-bullet">  the

        waterproof, and</li>

        <li class="x--Body-text-bullet">  the
        shelter should keep people safe and healthy.</li>
      </ul></div>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">The first task is to find out how to
    make fabric waterproof. The second task will be to find ways of
    making fabric fireproof. Your teacher did some research and
    found the following information.</p>

    <p><b>Different ways to make fabric waterproof</b></p>

    <ul><li class="x--Body-text-bullet">  Spray
      fabric with a commercial silicone spray.</li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet">  Rub candle
      wax or petroleum jelly (Vaseline) on the fabric.</li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet">  Paint
      fabric with any PVA paint.</li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet">  Cover
      fabric with transparent plastic contact sheeting. This
      plastic sheeting has a smooth front and a sticky back. You
      can also call it sticky-backed plastic.</li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet">  Mix
      &#189; cup cooking oil and  &#188; cup turpentine
      in a spray bottle. Spray the fabric a few times with the
      mixture.</li>
    </ul><p><b>Different
    ways to make fabric less likely to catch fire and
    burn</b></p>

    <ul><li class="x--Body-text-bullet">  Mix 2
      tablespoons borax with 1 cup hot water ina spray bottle.
      Spray fabric a few times until soaked.Leave to dry and spray
      again.</li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet">  Mix 2
      tablespoons borax and 1 tablespoon boric acidwith 1 cup hot
      water in a spray bottle. Spray thefabric, leave to dry and
      spray again. Repeat a few times.</li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet">
          Paint
        fabric with PVA paint and cover the fabric with sand on
        both sides while the paint is still wet.

        <div class="aside">
          <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent">Something that you add
          to make fabric or something else difficult to burn is
          called a "fire retardant".</p>

      </li>
    </ul><p><b>Get ready to
    conduct water and fire retardant experiments in your next
    lesson</b></p>

    <p class="x--Body-investigation-hanging">1. You will work in
    groups. Some groups will conduct the waterproof experiments and
    other groups the fire retardant experiments. Work in groups of
    eight. Each group will split up into four pairs. Get your
    groups and pairs together.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-investigation-hanging">2. Use identical
    pieces of cotton fabric for all theexperiments. Scrap pieces of
    canvas or denimwill be ideal. Each pair will need a piece of
    fabricmore or less 10&#160;cm&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#160;cm.</p>

    

    <p class="x--Body-investigation-hanging">3. You will need lots
    of old newspapers or magazinesto work on.</p>
<div class="aside">
      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent">To compare the different
      ways of treating fabric in a fair way, you need to use the
