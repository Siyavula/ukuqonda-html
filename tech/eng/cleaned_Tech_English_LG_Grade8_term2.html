    <p class="x--caption para-style-override-3">Figure 1: What is
    this swing made of?</p>

    <p class="x--Body-opener">Many years ago, people could only use
    the materials that they found in the <span class=
    "char-style-override-1">natural environment</span>. This means
    all of the natural things that are around us. It includes air,
    water, soil, plants and animals. Some examples of natural
    materials are wood, leather, clay and grass.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-opener">Today, people use many new materials
    that are not found in the natural environment. These materials
    are made in factories. They are often made from oil or coal
    that are found under ground. This includes materials like
    plastic, certain paints, and certain fabrics used to make
    clothes. You may have heard of "polyester clothes", "PVA paint"
    and "neoprene rubber". These are called <span class=
    "char-style-override-1">synthetic materials</span>.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-opener">Synthetic materials have many
    advantages. They are often more durable, lighter and cheaper
    than natural materials. Something is durable if it lasts for a
    long time.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-opener">But synthetic materials also have
    disadvantages. When they are thrown away, the waste lasts a
    long time. Therefore, it is better to use synthetic materials
    over and over again. This is called <span class=
    "char-style-override-1">reusing</span> materials.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-opener">Because synthetic materials are
    cheap, people can afford to buy more things that they want. One
    of the easiest ways to reduce the disadvantages of synthetic
    materials is to buy fewer things. This is called <span class=
    "char-style-override-1">reducing consumption</span>. Before you
    buy something new, ask yourself if you really need it.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-opener">There is another disadvantage to
    synthetic materials that most people do not see. Harmful waste
    is often formed at the factories where the synthetic materials
    are made. This waste can end up in the air, the water and the
    soil. Modern factories are designed better than older factories
    so that they release less harmful waste into the
    environment.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-opener--1-3- para-style-override-4">One good
    idea is to keep waste of synthetic materials separate from
    waste of natural materials. This is called <span class=
    "char-style-override-1">waste separation</span>.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-opener--1-3- para-style-override-4">Waste of
    natural materials is broken down in the natural environment to
    form harmless substances like compost. Some natural materials
    break up into harmless substances simply when they lie in the
    sun or in water for some time.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-opener--1-3- para-style-override-4">A
    material is called <span class=
    "char-style-override-1">biodegradable</span> if natural
    processes can break the material into small harmless
    pieces.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-opener--1-3- para-style-override-4">Materials
    that cannot break down naturally into harmless substances are
    called <span class=
    "char-style-override-1">non-biodegradable</span> materials.</p>

    <div class="frame-4">
      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent">Many people throw all their
      fruit and vegetable peels on a compost heap. They also throw
      dead leaves, small tree branches and cut grass on it.</p>

      <p class="x--Body-box">Over a few months, the waste on the
      compost heap changes into small dark pieces that feel like
      soft soil. This is called compost or humus. Compost is a
      valuable material, because plants grow better in soil that
      contains a lot of compost.</p>

      <p class="x--Body-box">A compost heap should be kept wet,
      warm and filled with air. You can do this by covering the
      heap with a plastic sheet, and mixing the compost once a
      week.</p>

    <p class="x--Head-investigation">Report: Reducing the negative
    impact of plastic bags</p>

    <p class="x--Body-story">Until 2003, South African shops gave
    customers free plastic bags to carry their shopping. These bags
    were very thin, and broke easily. This meant that the bags were
    thrown away after they were used.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-story">Our government wanted to reduce
    plastic waste. In 2003, it banned supermarkets from giving
    customers shopping bags for free, and banned the use of very
    thin plastic shopping bags. These bags are illegal.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-story">Since then, supermarkets ask customers
    to pay for thicker, stronger shopping bags that can be used
    over and over again. The bags still look very thin, but they
    are less thin than the shopping bags used before 2003.
    Customers can choose not to buy new bags, and rather take old
    shopping bags with them to the shops.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-story">The new, thicker plastic shopping bags
    are also easier to recycle by <span class=
    "char-style-override-3">recycling</span> factories. But this
    only helps if people separate their waste so that the plastic
    bags can be sent to a recycling factory.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">Think back about what you saw when you
    were looking at the contents of dustbins and garbage bags, and
    at plastic bags lying around outside. Write a half-page report
    about this to answer these four questions:</p>

    <p class="x--Body-investigation-hanging">1. Do you think that
    making people pay for thicker, reusable shopping bags helps to
    reduce the amount of plastic shopping bags that people throw
    away?</p>

    <p class="x--Body-investigation-hanging">2. Are some shops
    still giving away thin plastic shopping bags for free?</p>

    <p class="x--Body-investigation-hanging">3. What percentage of
    people do you think put their plastic waste separate, and not
    with their other waste?</p>

    <p class="x--Body-investigation-hanging">4. Are there other
    things people can do so that less plastic bags are thrown
    away?</p>

    <h2>9.1 What are paper and cardboard made of?</h2>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">A paper recycling factory makes new
    paper or cardboard out of waste paper. The way this is done is
    explained below. You can also make recycled paper at home.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-investigation-hanging--1-3-">1. Waste paper
    is mixed with warm water and chemicals. It is stirred and
    chopped up by a machine to separate the thin little fibres the
    paper is made of. The machine that stirs and chops up the
    mixture of paper and water, works like a food blender.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-investigation-hanging--1-3-">The mixture of
    chopped-up paper and water is called paper <span class=
    "Body-bold">pulp</span>.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-investigation-hanging--1-3-">2. The pulp is
    poured through a <span class=
    "char-style-override-3">sieve</span>. Old <span class=
    "Body-bold char-style-override-3">glue</span> and fibres that
    are very short pass through the sieve. Long, strong fibres
    remain on top. These fibres then go to a stirred tank where
    chemicals are added to remove ink from the pulp.</p>

    <p class=
    "x--Body-investigation-hanging--1-3- para-style-override-17">3.
    New glue is added to the pulp. Some clay is also added if the
    recycled paper will be used for writing or printing, because
    the clay gives the paper a smoother surface.</p>

    <p class=
    "x--Body-investigation-hanging--1-3- para-style-override-18">4.
    The pulp goes to a paper-making machine, where it is pressed
    between two rollers to give it the required thickness, and to
    squeeze out water.</p>

    it is cut into the necessary size and packaged.</p>

    <p class="x--Body--above">Paper fibres can be recycled as many
    as seven times. But each time it is recycled, the fibres get
    broken into shorter and shorter fibres. If it is recycled too
    many times, the fibres become too short and weak to use for
    making paper again.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">When you traced the development of the

    you made the lines feint. Now use a ruler to draw <span class=

    your development. The dark lines has to show where the paper
    has to be cut. <span class="x--Bodyitalics">Do not draw dark

    something that you don't want to cut off!</span></p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">If you accidentally cut off something
    that you should not have cut off, don't worry. Most people make
    mistakes when they try to design and make a box for the first

    <p class="x--Body-investigation-hanging">Remember that your

    <p class="x--Body-Text">Now that you have successfully made a

    <div class="frame-57">
      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent">You will make a cardboard
      box this week, but you first have to learn a few <span class=

      technological work call tricks like these <span class=

      technique!</p>
    </div>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3">Cardboard is more difficult to

    need to learn a <span class="Body-bold">trick</span> for
    folding cardboard. You also need to learn how to join two
    pieces of cardboard together with glue. You will have to do it
    in such a way that the glue will dry quickly, and the joint

    <p class="x--Body--above"><span class="Body-bold">How to glue
    cardboard</span></p>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">You will join two pieces of cardboard
    with white wood glue. But first do an experiment to find out
    whether it is better to use a lot of glue, or only a little bit
    of glue.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3 para-style-override-30">Join two
    small pieces of cardboard with a thick layer of glue between

    it with your finger. Wood glue is not poisonous, and you can
    wash it off with water. The cardboard should look wet and
    shiny. It should not look white like the glue. Press the pieces
    of cardboard together for two minutes, then let go. Has the
    glue dried? Try to gently pull the two pieces of cardboard

    <p class="x--Body-Text"><span class="Body-bold">How to fold
    cardboard</span></p>

    <p class="x--Body-text-1-3">To fold cardboard to make a
    90&#194;&#176; bend, you first need to do the following
    experiment to find out what the best technique is.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3">Fold a rectangular piece of
    cardboard in half. Use a thick piece of cardboard, like the
    cardboard that a cereal box is made of. The length of the fold
    should be at least 10 cm. Cut three pieces of cardboard that
    you will fold in half in different ways.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3">With the first piece of
    cardboard, draw a pencil line on the inside and then fold along
    that line. Fold it all the way over, using the end of your
    pencil to make the fold sharp. Then bend it back so that it
    forms a 90&#194;&#176; bend.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3">To fold the second piece of
    cardboard, first make a groove on the outside of the cardboard.
    Put your ruler where you want the fold to be, then draw a line
    with a ball point pen. Press hard with the pen, to make a
    groove in the cardboard. Grip the ruler tightly so that it does
    not move while you draw the line. Draw the same line two or
    three times, to make the groove deeper. Fold the cardboard
    along this groove. Fold it all the way over, using the end of
    your pencil to make the fold sharp. Then bend it back so that
    it forms a 90&#194;&#176; bend.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3">To fold the third piece of
    cardboard, first make two grooves on the inside of the
    cardboard. Make a groove in the same way as before. The two
    grooves should be parallel, and 1 mm to 2 mm apart. Fold the
    cardboard along these grooves. Fold it all the way over, using
    the end of your pencil to make the fold sharp. Then bend it
    back so that it forms a 90&#194;&#176; bend.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3">Now look closely at each of the
    three folds. Is it a neat fold? Are there any cracks on the
    outside of the fold? Was it easy or difficult to make the fold?
    Is the fold exactly where you wanted it to be?</p>

    <p class="x--Body-Text para-style-override-6">Which way of
    folding do you think is the best?</p>

    <h2>9.5 Your final box</h2>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">Use the cardboard box that you folded
    flat to trace the same design onto a flat sheet of cardboard.
    (See Figure 12 on page 132.) Use feint lines. Once again draw
    the glued tab in the position where it was originally attached
    to the single piece of cardboard.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Do the same as you did to make your
    paper model of the box. But this time, use the best technique
    to make a fold in the cardboard.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">When you have cut and folded the
    cardboard, first test whether it will make a box, and that all
    the tabs are there. If it is correct, then glue the one tab to
    the face to which it should be glued. Use the right amount of
    glue.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">If you have time left in the lesson,
    also do the following activity.</p>

    <p class="x--Head-extension">Something extra you could do to
    make your boxclose better</p>

    <div class="Basic-Text-Frame frame-60">
      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent">Look closely at the tabs of
      a pill box. You will see small cuts in some of the tabs. What

    <h2>9.6 Make a pencil case</h2>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">Design a new box of a different size.
    The new box will be used as a pencil case. You should be able
    to fit two pencils, two pens, an eraser and a sharpener in it.
    You will design the pencil case by using the same ideas that
    you used to make your previous cardboard box.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">First make a rough plan of how the
    development for the box will look. Do this on the next page.
    The rough plan should show all the <span class=

    Dimensions mean the same as measurements. To draw up the rough
    plan as quickly as possible, make the drawing by hand, without
    a ruler.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Then draw the plan accurately on a
    piece of cardboard, using your ruler to measure and draw
    straight lines. Remember to use dashed lines to show where the
    paper will be folded. Do not cut along the dashed lines.</p>

    <h2>The hidden cost of electricity</h2>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">In the last few years, the cost of
    electricity has increased a lot. Some people are unhappy about
    this, because they don't have enough money to pay for
    electricity.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3">Electricity also has another cost
    that has nothing to do with money. This is the "cost" of
    electricity to the environment. Just like the amount of money
    that people have changes when they pay for electricity, so the
    environment changes when electricity is generated.</p>

    <div class="frame-66">
      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent">To make electricity is
      usually called to <span class=
      "char-style-override-1">generate</span> electricity.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">This week, you will learn how the
    environment is changed by electricity generation. This change
    is often bad for the environment. You can say that electricity
    generation has a <span class="char-style-override-3">negative
    impact</span> on the environment.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">You will think about ways that this
    negative impact can be reduced.</p>

    <p class="x--Body--above">The boy followed the electricity
    lines to see where electricity comes from. When he went inside
    the power plant, a technician told him how a coal-fired power
    plant works. This is what she told him:</p>

    <p class="x--Body-story para-style-override-37">"In a power
    station, coal is burnt underneath a tank full of water that is
    called a boiler. The heat from the fire makes the water boil
    and evaporate to form steam with a high pressure. The high
    pressure steam blows through a turbine and makes it turn. This
    is very much like the wind making a wind pump turn. A device
    called a generator converts the rotational movement of the
    turbine into electricity.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-story para-style-override-38">The gases and
    smoke from the fire passes through a filter before it goes
    through the chimney into the air. The filter removes most of
    the ash and soot particles, so that there is only a little bit
    of smoke that comes out the top of the chimney."</p>

      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent">When a balloon bursts, or
      when there is a puncture in a bicycle or a motorcar tyre, the
      air inside bursts out very quickly and strongly. This is
      because the air inside a balloon and a tyre is under high
      pressure.</p>

    <hr />
    <hr />

    <p class="x--Body--above">There are many different materials or
    substances that you can burn to create heat and light. Wood,
    coal, paraffin, gas and oil are some of the substances that you
    know about. They are called <span class=
    "char-style-override-3">fuels</span>. All of these fuels
    contain <span class="char-style-override-3">carbon</span>.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3">Carbon is one of the main
    building blocks from which plants and animals are made. These
    building blocks are very small. It is impossible to see them.
    Carbon is a solid.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3">Carbon stores energy, like a
    battery. When carbon is on its own, you can say the battery is
    charged. When the carbon is <span class=
    "char-style-override-3">bonded</span> with another small
    building block called <span class=
    "char-style-override-3">oxygen</span>, then the battery is
    flat. Oxygen <span>is a gas. When carbon is bonded to oxygen,
    they are tog</span>ether called <span class=
    "char-style-override-3">carbo</span><span class=
    "char-style-override-3">n dioxide</span><span>. Carbon dioxide
    is a gas</span>.</p>

    <div class="frame-75">
      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent">When two very small building
      blocks of a material are close together, they stick together,
      as if they were glued with very strong glue. This is called
      <span class="char-style-override-1">chemical bonding</span>.
      You will learn more about this later when you do chemistry in
      natural science.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="x--Body-Text para-style-override-41">Go outside on a
    very cold but sunny winter's day. Let the sunlight shine on
    your hand. Why does your hand start to feel warm, even though
    the air around it is very cold? It is because the sunlight is
    changed into heat, inside your skin. Light and heat are two
    different forms of energy. Movement and electricity are two
    other forms of energy.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-Text para-style-override-41">When carbon
    bonds with oxygen, energy is released in the form of heat:
    carbon + oxygen = carbon dioxide + energy.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">This is what happens when an animal
    eats food that contains carbon and breathes air that contains
    oxygen. The carbon and oxygen combine inside the animal to give
    it energy and to make it grow. The same thing happens when
    plant material containing carbon burns in air.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-Text para-style-override-41">To separate
    carbon and oxygen that is bonded, energy is needed. Plants
    separate carbon and oxygen by using the energy of sunlight:
    carbon dioxide + light = carbon + oxygen.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-text-1-3 para-style-override-42">Plants use
    the carbon to grow, because carbon is the main building block
    of plants. They release the oxygen back into the air.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-text-1-3 para-style-override-43">The change
    of carbon into carbon dioxide and thenback into carbon is
    called the <span class="char-style-override-3">carbon
    cycle</span>. This is shown in the picture on the next
    page.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-Text para-style-override-41">When you make a
    fire or burn gas or paraffin in your house, carbon dioxide is
    released into the air. When you use an electrical stove, no
    carbon dioxide is released from your house. But carbon dioxide
    is released from a power plant that makes the electricity you
    use.</p>

    Greenhouses keep plants warm in winter, by using the energy of

    it is warmer inside a greenhouse than outside. Greenhouses can

    <h2>How can the negative impact of electricity generation be
    reduced? (60 minutes)</h2>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">Later this year, you will learn about
    different kinds of power stations. Some of them release less or
    no carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. There is hope that in
    future, less electricity will be generated by coal-fired power
    stations. But m<span>ost electricity is still generated by
    coal-fired power stations, and this is not going to change
    soon.</span></p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">You will now discuss what the
    <span class="char-style-override-12">users</span> of
    electricity can do to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide
    released into the atmosphere. Every time you switch on a kettle
    or another electrical appliance, you use electricity. The more
    electricity people use, the more electricity the power stations
    have to generate.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">There is also a <span class=
    "char-style-override-12">hidden way of using
    electricity</span>. Every time you buy something that was made
    in a factory, the factory used electricity to make the product.
    If people bought less of those products, then the factories
    would be smaller and use less electricity.</p>

    <p class="x--Head-investigation">Investigate: What can you do
    to release less carbon dioxide?</p>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">In this lesson, your teacher will lead
    the whole class in a discussion about how ordinary people can
    use less electricity, or burn less wood, gas or paraffin. The
    following questions will give you some ideas for your
    discussion:</p>

    <p class="x--Body-investigation-hanging">1. When you make tea
    or coffee, how much water do you put into the kettle to boil?
    Do you put in more water than you need? Does the amount of
    water that you boil have an effect on how much electricity you
    consume? (1)</p>
    <hr />
    <hr />
    <hr />

    <p class="x--Body-investigation-hanging">2. When you leave a

    of electricity you use? (1)</p>
    <hr />
    <hr />

    <p class="x--Body-investigation-hanging">3. Many houses have an
    electrical geyser to heat water. A geyser is a water tank that
    supplies hot water to taps. An electric element in a geyser
    heats the water, just like an electric element inside a kettle
    heats water.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-investigation-hanging">Sarah takes a warm

    <div class="Basic-Text-Frame frame-82">
      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent">Below is one idea for using
      less electricity or fuel when cooking:</p>

      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent">Bring the food to boiling
      point in a pot on the stove. Then take the pot off the stove
      and wrap it in a thick jacket to keep it very hot. Leave it
      there for two to three hours. The idea is the same as a
      person dressing very warmly on a cold day. To wrap a jacket
      around a pot to keep it warm is called <span class=
      "char-style-override-1">insulating</span> the pot.</p>

      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent">The photo below shows an
      insulated cooking box that was used to cook rice. This box
      was made from waste materials. Before the towel was wrapped
      around it, the box felt slightly warm after the pot was put
      into it. That meant that heat was escaping from the pot. So
      an extra layer of insulation was added by wrapping a towel
      around the box. The towel was carefully wrapped around the
      box, so that it covered every part of the box. If some part
      of the box was not covered by the towel, heat could have
      escaped from that part of the box. It took two hours to cook
      the rice.</p>

    <h2>Save energy by using less building materials</h2>

    <p class="x--Body-text-1-3">Factories use electricity or burn

    can say that there is an <span class=

    <p class="x--Body-indent">How can the amount of carbon dioxide
    that isreleased into the atmosphere be reduced? One way isto
    design things cleverly so that less material is needed to build

    amount of carbon dioxide in the air.</p>

    too, steel rods or mesh is placed in the concrete when the wet
    concrete is poured into a shape or <span class=

    <p class="x--Body-text-1-3">Wood is made of fibres that are

    of the wood, and it can be seen as thin parallel lines.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-text-1-3">Wood often cracks in the direction

    rubber is an <span class="char-style-override-3">elastic</span>
    material. Elastic bands are also made from rubber. When a
    tensile force is applied to an elastic rubber band, it gets
    longer. It also gets thinner.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent para-style-override-1">Dry wood is
    only a little bit elastic, so it cannot get much longer when
    you apply a tensile force to it. Therefore, when the tensile
    force is too big, the wood will crack. You can also say the
    wood will <span class="char-style-override-3">fracture</span>.
    Note that the wood cracks at the top or outside of the bend,

    <h2>Steel I-beams (60 minutes)</h2>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">Metal beams can be shaped in special

    a shape that resists bending very well.</p>

    in buildings. Wood I-beams are often used during the
    construction of a building, but are removed once the building
    can support its own weight.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">The pictures below compare the
    resistance to bending of an I-beam, to the resistance to
    bending of a rectangular-shaped beam. Both beams have the same
    length between the two supports. And the load is the same on

    are made from the same amount of material. That means that the
    weight of both beams are the same, and the cost of the material
    will be the same. Which beam bends the most under the weight of
    the load?</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Because an I-beam resists bending
    better, a lighter and cheaper I-beam can be used to carry the
    same load as a rectangular beam. That also means that less
    steel will have to be made, so less energy will be used to make
    steel. In this way, clever design of material helps to reduce
    the negative impact of technology on the environment.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent para-style-override-7">In the rest of
    the lesson, you will investigate <span class=

    have to understand what forces act at different places in a

    <p class="x--Body-text-1-3 para-style-override-60">In the

    <p class="x--Body-Text">Engineers wanted to design a new shape
    for a beam that will resist bending more than beam B, but
    without buckling like beam C. They knew that the material in
    the middle of a beam does help a lot to resist bending, because
    it does not stretch or compress a lot in the middle of a beam
    when it bends. Figure 33 explains this.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">So they took the design of beam B,
    and removed some material from the middle and rather added it
    to the top and bottom, where there will be more stretching and
    compression. In this way, they made the beam taller, but they
    also added short horizontal parts at the top and the bottom to
    prevent the beam from buckling sideways. This is shown in the
    pictures below.</p>

    <h2>Build a model of a house</h2>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">A lot of electricity or fuel is used to
    heat a building when it's cold, or to cool it when it's
    hot.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">This week, you will build a cardboard
    model of a house from the plans you will be given. Then you
    will design and make changes to the house so that it will need
    less heating in summer, and less cooling in winter.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Some of the changes you will make
    will be <span class="char-style-override-12">inside</span> the
    house, and others will be <span class=
    "char-style-override-12">outside</span>. You will build a model
    of only one half of a house, as if the house has been cut open
    along the length of the roof. This will make it easy to work
    inside the small cardboard house to make changes to it. It will
    also make it easy for other people to see the changes you have
    made.</p>

    of the cardboard model that you will build. The walls and the
    floor are made out of one piece of cardboard. The roof and the
    inside wall of the house are made of two other pieces of
    cardboard. There are also thin strips of cardboard that will
    close the places where the windows are cut out and the door is
    cut open.</p>

    Rather use Prestik, because you might want to take out the
